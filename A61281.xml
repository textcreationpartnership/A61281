            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MY Reader had been ſpared the Trouble of a Preface, were it not that I think he may receive ſome Advantage towards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting by the following Sermons, from having a ſhort Scheme laid before him of my general Deſign, and of that Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which theſe Diſcourſes, though compoſed at ſeveral times and upon very different Occaſions, yet, as now conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in one Volume, have upon each other.</p>
            <p>The End I propoſed to my ſelf was the the perſwading Men to the diligent and conſtant Practice of Religion, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to draw them off from ſuch Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Opinions as ſeem more eſpecially to obſtruct or diſcourage it. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Serm. I.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Firſt</hi> Step I make is to ſhew the Neceſſity and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of attending to
<pb facs="tcp:49873:5"/> the plain Preceptive Parts of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, in Oppoſition to that wrangling and ſpeculative Humour, ſo predominant in this Age; As if the Perfection of a Wiſe and Good Man were to be placed only in exalted Notions, deep Enquiries, and skill in dark and controverted Points. Which indeed are ſo far from making the generality of thoſe who attend to them the better, that, one would almost be tempted to think by the modern way of managing theſe Matters, they ſcarce leave them the Spirit of Chriſtians. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Serm. II.</note> Hence I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the <hi>Second</hi> Sermon to explain the Meaſures of that Purity, which the Goſpel requires in the Converſation of every one who would abandon a wicked Courſe in good earneſt. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Serm. III.</note> For an Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to which difficult <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, my <hi>Third</hi> treats of the Juſtice and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, in diſtributing the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Evangelical Diſpenſation, as our Lord hath repreſented them in the Parable of thoſe Labourers, who were hired into the Vineyard at the Eleventh Hour. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Serm. IV.</note> But, being well aware withal, how perverſe a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe might be made of that Parable, I eſteem'd it my Duty, from the Inſtance of <hi>the Thief upon the Croſs,</hi> to lay open thoſe Cheats Men too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:49873:5"/> put upon themſelves, by a falſe Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſuch Encouragements, as the Scripture is ſuppoſed to allow a Late or Death-Bed Repentance. Hoping that theſe Conſiderations might be effectual for bringing my Reader to a Sight and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Senſe of the Neceſſity of a ſpeedy Reformation; <note place="margin" type="runSum">Ser. V, VI.</note> I thought the Frailty of Humane Nature, and an Account of thoſe Ingredients which make up a true Repentance, might follow very ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; which St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Fall</hi> and <hi>Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> may ſerve for a convenient Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of. Moreover, in regard the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſpeak of a very remarkable Change, effected by the Spirit of God in our Hearts, which, by Reaſon of its Agent and Operation being inviſible, hath been by Some exploded and denyed as a Fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Notion, by Others miſinterpreted to the great hazard of Souls, for an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, Neceſſary and Inſtantaneous Act; <note place="margin" type="runSum">Serm. VII. VIII.</note> The Next Thing that ſeem'd requiſite was, to maintain the Certainty, to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Manner, and to ſhew the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Conditions, of this ſpiritual Regeneration. In all which Argument the Truth ows ſo much to the accurate La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of a late learned and excellent Perſon of our own Church, <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Clag.</hi> Operations of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> that it is hard
<pb facs="tcp:49873:6"/> for any Man who treats of this Subject af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, not to tread more cloſely in his Steps, than ſuch as read more for Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment than Edification, are like to be very well contented with.</p>
            <p>Having thus led my Reader gradually to the Change from an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate, to the truly Chriſtian State; I thought it reaſonable to conſider ſome of thoſe Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which might check his vigorous Advances in it. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Ser. IX, X.</note> Among theſe the First are thoſe erroneous Principles, which I have endeavoured to refute, by ſhewing the true Importance of the Parable of the <hi>Marriage Feaſt,</hi> and what Inferences may fairly be drawn from thence, for ſetting the Ordinary Methods of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's <hi>Calling</hi> and Election in their true Light. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Serm. XI.</note> And then from another Paſſage of the like Parable in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to urge the Neceſſity of Religion, and a ſtrict and conſtant Regard to it, upon the Men who plead Worldly Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Lawful Cares, in excuſe for their Neglect of Spiritual Duties. But ſome there are of a Complexion ſo different from thoſe laſt mentioned, that they think they never have done, never can do enough; <note place="margin" type="runSum">Serm. XII, XIII, XIV.</note> Inſtead of following their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Affairs, and indulging their una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
<pb facs="tcp:49873:6"/> Infirmities, they ſink under the Burden of Both; and imagine that they are lost, becauſe not ſufficiently Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized: Their Frailties and Imperfections they look upon as Marks of wanting true Grace and ſaving Faith: And, for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring that Eaſe and Encouragement due to Perſons thus diſpoſed, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered at large, the Caſe of a <hi>Weak</hi> and <hi>Imperfect Faith,</hi> and the Scruples which are moſt uſually obſerved to ariſe from it. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Serm. XV.</note> 
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Since, in deſpight of all the Declarations to be found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Contrary, and of all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reſulting from the Natural Tendency of the <hi>Thing;</hi> Affliction is by ſome weak or carnal Minds reputed a conſtant Mark of God's Diſpleaſure, and a Hindrance, rather than any Help, to a Chriſtian's Obedience; I ſhut up this Volume with a View of our Bleſſed Lord's <hi>Reſignation</hi> to his Heavenly Father's Will, and ſuch Reflections drawn from thence, as may be both our Comfort and Direction under any Calamities, which it ſhall pleaſe God to lay upon us.</p>
            <p>This ſhort Account is what I thought a ſeaſonable Introduction, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might come a little prepared, and
<pb facs="tcp:49873:7"/> know beforehand what he is to expect. In which, if, after all, he find himſelf at any time diſappointed; I beg him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he himſelf alſo is a Man; and that my Deſire is rather to profit than to pleaſe all into whoſe Hands theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſhall come. If they who peruſe them are made better Chriſtians, my Purpoſe is anſwered, and my Pains rewarded ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually. And to this best of all Effects, I most humbly beg of God, to render my poor Labours in ſome degree Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>

            <p>OUR Bleſſed Saviour, at the Eighteenth Verſe, had ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> by what particular ſort of Death he ſhould glorify God. He, upon hearing his own Fate determin'd, enquires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning St. <hi>John,</hi> the Author of this Goſpel, how Chriſt intended to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Him. But our Lord, not thinking fit to gratify his Curioſity in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49873:10"/> this Point, makes the Reply contained in my Text; <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The natural Importance of which Anſwer, is, no doubt, a Reproof to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s unneceſſary Inquiſitiveneſs into a Matter, which it no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd him to know: And an Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion withal, that the great and only thing he ought to be ſolicitous for, was to prepare himſelf for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his own Duty. And, as Providence intended to liken him to his Maſter in the manner of his Death, ſo his Thoughts ſhould be employed in taking good heed to be like him, in a meek, and patient, and conſtant ſuffering of the Tryals appointed for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Now the Rebuke applyed here to one particular Inſtance, I ſhall ſo treat of at this time, as to render it an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of general Uſe and Benefit. For ſuch, no doubt, it may prove to every Chriſtian, if we from this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample take the hint of forbearing to indulge all needleſs Curioſities in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion: And, bending our Studies to thoſe Objects which have a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49873:10"/> direct Tendency to Practice and a good Life, lay aſide ſuch aiery Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, as deſervedly fall under this Reprehenſion of our Saviour; <hi>If it be thus, or thus, what is that to thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I would fain hope, That even in this buſy and pretending Age of Ours, men might be prevailed upon, thus far to conſult their own Eaſe and Benefit, would they but ſeriouſly conſider theſe Three Arguments.
<list>
                  <item>1. Firſt, <hi>That Many, if not Moſt, of the abſtruſe Points of Religion are beſet with ſuch Difficulties, as they cannot receive any poſitive and full Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Secondly, <hi>That could they go to the bottom of all theſe Difficulties, yet ſuch Knowledge would be of little, or no real uſe to them.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. Thirdly, <hi>That the employing their Thoughts in ſuch intricate Questions, is not only fruitleſs but dangerous; and many times of very fatal Conſequence, to themſelves, to others, and to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in general.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This I ſhall endeavour to convince you, is ordinarily the Caſe of thoſe nice and curious Perſons, who ſpend their time and pains in the ſpeculative
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49873:11"/> Parts of Religion: And not only ſo, but I ſhall urge withal, that the Study of the Practical and neceſſary Duties is the very Reverſe of all this. That theſe are very poſſible to be attain'd; exceeding profitable when underſtood; and that all the Hours and Induſtry laid out upon them, turn to the trueſt, the beſt account, both for our Selves, and for the Publick.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>My firſt Diſcouragement against curious Speculations in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion conſiſts in this; that they are entangled with ſuch Difficulties, as men cannot receive any poſitive and particular Satisfaction in.</hi> And would not one chooſe of the two, rather to ſit ſtill and be idle, than to travel through Briars and Thorns, and after infinite Toil and Trouble, give out at laſt, heartily tired with one's Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but ſtill as far from the End, as when he firſt ſet out? And yet this is the Conſequence of thoſe ſublime Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſubtle Diſtinctions, which have taken up the Thoughts, and employed the Pens, and ſwell'd the Volumes of a great many Learned Men in almoſt all, but eſpecially in theſe later, Ages of the Church. The Myſterious Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49873:11"/> of the Bleſſed Trinity, and that of two Natures in the Perſon of our Saviour Chriſt: The Secrets of Providence, and the Methods of Divine Grace; the State of Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and the particular Nature and Quality of thoſe Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which await men in the next World. Theſe, and abundance more ſuch Points there are, in which the Scriptures have given us ſome general Inſight, as much as is neceſſary for our preſent purpoſe. But when men, <hi>not content to be wiſe according to that which is written,</hi> plunge themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Controverſies, about the particular Modes and Circumſtances of them, the farther they wade, the more they are carried out of their Depth. And how ſhould it be otherwiſe indeed? For when all is ſaid and done, theſe are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects not of a ſize with us; our own Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is not qualified to fathom them. The Light from above is our only ſafe Guide in theſe matters: So far then as this leads us, we may go on boldly, and ſtand upon ſure and firm ground; but where that Light forſakes us, all the Diſcoveries pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to beyond, muſt needs be very
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49873:12"/> fanciful, and precarious, and weak. So full of Deluſion are thoſe very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Contemplations, which loſe the Mind in matters too high for it; ſo liable to that Reproach of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. I. 21, 22.</note> though in another Signification of the words; for <hi>Theſe men too becoming vain in their Imaginations, their fooliſh heart is darkned, and profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be wiſe, they become Fools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the moſt important part of Religion is of a quite different kind. For, thoſe things which the Goſpel commands to be believed, or done, in order to Salvation, lie level to every ordinary Capacity. Thus for Belief; It asks no mighty Depth, for a Man to convice himſelf, <hi>that</hi> what the God of Truth hath revealed, ought readily to be embraced; <hi>that</hi> He, who was pleaſed to declare his Will to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, did certainly do it with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to be underſtood; <hi>that</hi> therefore we ought to take his word in its plain and natural Senſe, except where there appears manifeſt Reaſon to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: <hi>That</hi> its containing ſome things which we cannot perfectly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, (eſpecially when treating of God's own Nature, and Operations)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49873:12"/> is no good Argument of any Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to take him otherwiſe. Becauſe our Reaſon tells us, that God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and yet it tells us at the ſame time too, that infinite he could not be, if a finite Mind could fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him. In a word, it requires Modeſty and Integrity, rather than A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteneſs and Skill, to be ſatisfied, that the true and proper Foundation of Faith is, not the Quality or Perſpicuity of the things revealed, but the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Teſtimony of the Party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing. Theſe are matters that lie ſufficiently fair and open to every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Perſon; and They who come to the Scriptures with theſe Impreſſions, will find no difficulty in aſſenting to what they meet with there; nor any occaſion for flying to wretched Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms, as an Expedient for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the loftieſt Doctrines to their own narrow Apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>So again; for the Moral Precepts of Piety, and Juſtice, and Charity, and Purity, and Meekneſs, and Patience, and Perſeverance, and the like; Theſe are ſo ſuited to our natural Notions of God and Goodneſs, that, if a Man hath but once thrown off the dead weight
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49873:13"/> of his own Prejudices and corrupt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, they cannot but caſt the Scale againſt the contrary Vices. Nor muſt I, upon this occaſion, forget to put put you in mind, that the Practice of Religion is a mighty Help to our more compleat Knowledge of it. It is ſo, as it engages our diligent Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fervent Love to that which is good. It is ſo, as it ſecures Probity of Mind, a teachable and impartial Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. It is ſo, as it entitles us to the Bleſling of God upon our Studies: Whoſe Goodneſs will never ſuffer thoſe who ſerve and ſeek him with their whole Heart, to continue in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and fatal Miſtakes. So manifeſt is the Advantage of applying our ſelves to this part of Religion, in which a Chriſtian's proper Buſineſs lies; So poſſible, ſo certain, that all who do ſo, ſhall effectually improve by their Endeavours; So unalterable that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of him, who came to direct us in the right Way to Happineſs, that <note n="*" place="margin">John. VII. 17.</note> 
               <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall not fail to know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> My next Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt indulging nice and curious Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49873:13"/> of this kind, is taken from the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitableneſs of them.</hi> Our Lord, had he ſo pleaſed, could have informed St. <hi>Peter,</hi> what ſhould become of this beloved Diſciple: But he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves his enquiring into it, becauſe no Benefit was to be had by ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. For ſo we may very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably interpret that Paſſage, <hi>If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">How wilt thou be the better, if I ſhould tell thee what this Man ſhall do? What Furtherance can it prove to thy Preparation for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Me, to know whether he ſhall be required to tread in the ſame Steps?</q> And I cannot but think it would puzzle the wiſeſt Man alive, to give a ſatisfactory account, what ends, of Conſequence to our Everlaſting Happineſs, would be ſerved, by being let into a clear and diſtinct View of all thoſe dark, myſterious Truths, which are now in ſo great a degree lockt up from us; or how Religion would, upon thoſe Terms, be in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter State than now it is.</p>
            <p>Let us put the Caſe in one or two of theſe Inſtances already mentioned, <hi>that</hi> the Trinity of Perſons in Unity
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49873:14"/> of the Divine Eſſence, and the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Son of God were fully underſtood by us. I deſire to know now, whether this would at all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our Zeal in the Love and Service of God; or what one Argument we ſhould then have, which at preſent we have not, for being better Men, or more thankful Chriſtians. The true ground of our Reverence and Fear, our Love and Truſt in God, is a due Senſe of his Holineſs and Wiſdom, his Power, and Juſtice, and Goodneſs. And what dependence, I beſeech you, have our Notions of theſe Attributes, upon our knowing how God is <hi>Three</hi> in <hi>One?</hi> The proper Motives to a Chriſtian Life are Gratitude, and a juſt Regard to the adorable Myſtery of Man's Redemption; the Mercy of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Sins pardoned, and ſatisfied for; the Rewards propoſed to our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience, the terrible Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of obſtinate Offenders, and the little Reaſon we have to flatter our ſelves with hopes of <hi>eſcaping,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. II. 3.</note> 
               <hi>if we neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi> Now theſe Affections ſpring from our conſidering the infinite Kindneſs and Condeſcention of the Son of God,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49873:14"/> who humbled himſelf to do ſo many wonderful, and to ſuffer ſo many bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, things for our Sakes. But the Mercy of his doing and enduring theſe things in Nature, will not touch our hearts one whit the more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for diſcerning how this Nature of Ours was united to his Divine Nature. It is the thing's being done, and not the particular manner by which it was done, that muſt have this Effect upon us. So likewiſe for the reſt; The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Divine Grace would not be more prevalent, nor is Their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, who ſtifle and reſiſt them, leſs deſerved; becauſe we ſee not all the Springs, by which the Holy Spirit moves and bends us. It is ſufficient, that he acts as he does, to render both our Obedience poſſible, and our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy inexcuſable. The Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fitted to contain men in their Duty, are the Greatneſs and the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Puniſhments threatned to wicked Livers: As, on the other hand, the powerful Incentives to doing and ſuffering with Conſtancy what God appoints us to, are the Excellence and the Aſſurance of a future Recompence. But, if the being warn'd in ſo ſolemn
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49873:15"/> and expreſs a manner as we are, that Torments everlaſting and extream re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for the Ungodly, will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us from being ſuch our ſelves; neither would we be reſtrained, though God had told us, whether that Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be material Fire, or whether it be ſuch, as for the exquiſite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable Anguiſh of it, was thought convenient to be repreſented to us by Everlaſting Burnings. If we will not be perſwaded to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>die unto the Lord,</hi> by theſe ſupporting Reflections, that <note place="margin">Rom. VIII. 18.</note> 
               <hi>the Sufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that ſhall be revealed in us,</hi> and, that it neither hath entred nor can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">1 Cor. II. 9.</note> 
               <hi>into the heart of man to conceive</hi> the <hi>things which God hath prepared for them that love him;</hi> What additional Force could theſe Reflections poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, by our being acquainted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in each Excellence of that Glory, and theſe Joys conſiſts? For ſtill the ſame Temptations to Sin and Infidelity, would continue: And They who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to take God's Word for the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the Certainty of future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments, (which are the only Qualifications neceſſary to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49873:15"/> quicken us in our Duty) would not have wanted any one Objection, which they now pretend to urge, againſt whatever God ſhould have revealed concerning the Nature and Quality of thoſe Rewards and Puniſhments. If men ſhall be Happy or Miſerable for ever, and as Happy or Miſerable as they are capable of being; it matters not much after what manner they ſhall be ſo: That they ſhall be ſo at all, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Will of God, that they believe they ſhall be ſo, is from an Aſſent to the Word of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that Will. And if the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God find no Credit, as to theſe things in general, there is but little appearance; that it would have gained more Credit, had he deſcribed the whole Proceſs, and deſcended to every Circumſtance of theſe things: For the Truth and Declaration of God being the only Motive of Aſſent common to both theſe Caſes; it unavoidably follows, that there would be the ſame reaſon for witholding it in the One, that there can poſſibly be in the Other.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſhall I carry this Point a little higher? I may do it; and dare appeal to all that hear me, whether in the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49873:16"/> Judgment of every conſiderate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd Chriſtian, it be not for the Dignity and Advantage of Religion, that ſome Articles of it exceed the largeſt humane Comprehenſion. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhould entertain the ſame aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Impreſſions of the Divine Majeſty, if the Perfections of his Nature and Operations were ſuch only, as we could ſee to the end of, and in every reſpect account to our Reaſon for. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it do not raiſe the value of Man's Redemption, to have been brought about by Miracles of Mercy, not only without Example, but even beyond our preſent Underſtanding. Had all theſe things been leſs, we ſhould have known them better; but ſo much as you abate of them to bring them near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Mens Capacity, ſo much you weaken the Power of them upon their Affections. And the influencing mens Affections, is the direct and great Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Religion: For Theſe are the Springs that move us, and according as They are ſet higher or lower, we ſhall be ſure to act with more or leſs Vigour. It is therefore, in Reality, the very Commendation and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of theſe Doctrines, that they are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49873:16"/> ſo far above us; becauſe the height and greatneſs of the Subject is more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the ends they were deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promote, than their being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and intelligible throughout, could poſſibly have rendred them. We ſhould eſteem it an inſtance of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs no leſs than Wiſdom, ſo to have tempered his Revelations, that we want no Knowledge fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our Piety, and holy Wonder; and yet we have not ſo much, as ſhould deſtroy our Humility and Reverence. In a Word, both the Light which is allowed us, and that which is denied us, if a right uſe be made of both, do mutually conſpire to carry on the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Religion. And we have reaſon to believe, it could not have been better; nay, probably not near ſo well, if either leſs had been diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, or leſs concealed from us.</p>
            <p>So ſmall Improvement is there to be had from bold and buſy Intruſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe Secrets, which God hath, like <hi>the Ark of old,</hi> forbidden to be ſeen. But now a diligent Attendance upon the plain Preceptive parts of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Inſtitution, This brings in vaſt and preſent Profit, ſuch as grows every
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49873:17"/> day upon our hands, and approves it ſelf to all the World, by its viſible and excellent Effects. For This hath a direct Influence upon the Diſpoſitions and Manners of Men, corrects depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Nature, and cultivates thoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which contribute to our own Perfection, and the Good of Others. This puts us upon making our Light ſhine before men, by filling the Poſt Providence hath placed us in. It ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures a diligent and faithful Regard to thoſe ſeveral Capacities and Relations, in the ſatisfying whereof not only the Peace and Happineſs of the World, but the good Pleaſure of God, and the Duty of each Perſon's particular Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiſts. And God, who is a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of men, thinks himſelf much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſerved, when we become uſeful, and publick Bleſſings to the Age we live in, than by the moſt refined Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and rapturous Contemplation. Theſe, at the beſt, are but Perſonal and ſolitary Excellencies, and contribute little or nothing to the Common good: From hence, I preſume, it is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> prefers <note n="*" place="margin">Cor. XIII. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Charity</hi> before <hi>the Gift of Prophecy,</hi> and underſtanding <hi>all my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and all knowledge;</hi> aſſuring us
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49873:17"/> at the ſame time, That theſe are glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Advantages, which dazzle our Eyes with a falſe Light, as oft as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Perfection is placed in them; for that it is very poſſible for a Man, even ſuppoſing him to attain to all theſe, yet in the Eſteem of God ſtill <hi>to be nothing.</hi> Such Enforcement hath even the Authority of an Apoſtle given to my <hi>Second,</hi> which yet is not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Diſcouragement I have to urge: For,</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Such Speculations are not only uſeleſs, but <hi>extreamly dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous too, and many times of very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſequence To the Perſons employed in them; To others, and To Religion in general.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Perſons themſelves</hi> ſuffer by them, in being taken off from more uſeful and important Subjects: For the Difficulty of theſe devours their time, engroſſes their Thoughts, and leaves them neither Leiſure nor Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for attending to the plainer and weightier Matters of the Law. The Knowledge of our Duty, 'tis true, may be brought within a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, but the Practice of it requires all our time and pains. Paſſions and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49873:18"/> Luſts are not ſubdued in an Inſtant; and the Attacks of Temptation come on ſo thick, that our conſtant Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and utmoſt Care is no more than needs. They who employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as they ought, upon theſe Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, will find that Providence hath cut them out Work enough for their whole Lives. And were there no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inconvenience attending theſe nice Speculations, yet this alone, is too much in all Conſcience, that they rob thoſe men of a great portion of their time, who have no time to ſpare. The Knowledge of theſe will make no Article in our laſt great Account, and is what we may be very good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians without; but the practical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are expreſly given us in charge, and will be ſure to be ſtrictly reckon'd for: Theſe are ſo many Branches of the <hi>One thing neceſſary,</hi> and all is loſt, if we ſuffer any thing elſe to come in between, and take That away from us.</p>
            <p>But further yet, Such Curioſity does not only divert our more vigorous purſuit after Vertue, but it tinctures the Mind very ſtrongly with ſeveral ſorts of Vice. Hence the Apoſtle takes notice of a <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. VIII. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Knowledge which puffeth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49873:18"/> up,</hi> and ſets this in Oppoſition to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> which <hi>edifieth:</hi> And in another place, he deſcribes the Conſequence of not being content to reſt in the plain <hi>wholeſome words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by ſaying, <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. VI. 45.</note> That ſuch Perſons are <hi>proud, knowing nothing, but doting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Queſtions and Strifes of words, whereof cometh Envy, Strife, Railings, Evil Surmiſings, Perverſe Diſputings of men of corrupt minds.</hi> And this is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe but too viſible, that ſuch men grow immoderately ſond of ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Notions, by which they affect to diſtinguiſh themſelves: This engages them in Controverſy, which ſowrs their Temper, and ſharpens their Pens, and makes the Contention as hot and fierce, as if in theſe Quarrels too, that falſe Punctilio of fantaſtick Honour were to take place, never to acknowledge Satisfaction, till they have drawn Blood of their Adverſary. All which, as it is of infinite ill Conſequence to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo is it</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Matter of mighty Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal <hi>to Others.</hi> For Standers-by, though they ought not to do ſo, yet if they be ill diſpoſed, they will be but too apt to cover their own Irreligion with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49873:19"/> the pretence of vehement Diſputes, and indecent Heats about Religion; to fall into Scepticiſm and univerſal doubting, when they find men ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Differences, wherein, if others cannot form a clear Judgment, it is not to be wondred at. And ſuch, as all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are never like to be brought to one mind about, while the World endures: Nay, even Good men cannot but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and be diſpleaſed, to ſee ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate Admirers of Singularity and Diſtinctions, loſe Charity and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the very Life and Subſtance of Religion, while they are contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Subtleties of the Schools, which are in compariſon but as thin Air, and empty Shadows. And it would really move ones Indignation, that men ſhould have the Vanity to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, they do any true Service to the Cauſe of God and Religion, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govern'd Fervour, which ſeems to be little or not at all concern'd, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of Humanity and Juſtice, good Nature or good Manners, provided the Writer can but acquire to himſelf the Reputation of Smartneſs, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety, and Skill. And can there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a greater Calamity, not only to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49873:19"/> the Perſons thus corrupted and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, but, which is worſt of all,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To <hi>the Chriſtian Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in general,</hi> than to be thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairly dealt by? To have the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Goſpel falſly placed, in Matters wherein the Power and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Godlineſs does not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt? Can there be any Courſe more deſtructive to ſound Religion, than to repreſent it as a meer Science; as if men were better or worſe, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what they <hi>know,</hi> and not in proportion to what they <hi>do?</hi> And do not our Eyes plainly ſee the ill Effect of pretending to theſe lofty Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Are not men a thouſand times more intent upon the Diſputes between contending Parties, than they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Practice of that which all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties agree to be neceſſary? Do not even the Vulgar now a days, the People of every Age and Sex, and Condition, take an Eſtimate of their own Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by what they are able to ſay for, or againſt, ſome difficult and warmly debated Points; rather than by the Conformity of their Lives to the plain and indiſpenſable Duties? And whence all this, but from an itch of being
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49873:20"/> thought might Reaſoners, ignorant of none, not even the darkeſt and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Myſteries of Chriſt? And this Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is followed cloſe at the heels by a nauſeating of the moſt valuable and profitable Parts of Religion; for that every thing, wherein the true Worth and Advantage of them lies: I mean, the honeſt Plainneſs of all neceſſary Doctrines, and, that God hath not required Artifice, and Skill, and a great reach of Parts, but hath qualified the Simplicity of Babes, a common Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, aſſiſted with conſcientious Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, for working out Salvation. And how perverſe a humour is this, which thinks nothing worth its Study, which does not give it Trouble? Whereas, in truth, it is with our ſpiritual, as with our natural Food, That affords us beſt Nouriſhment, which is eaſieſt of Digeſtion; and the Man grows in both Reſpects, not by trying the Strength of his Stomach, but by the Health and Vigour, which proceeds from Exerciſe and Suſtenance duly diſtributed: For ſearch the Bible throughout, and you ſhall not find there ſo much as One ſingle Promiſe made to Knowledge, abſtracted from Practice: Action is that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49873:20"/> which muſt crown all our Studies; and what our Saviour ſaid to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, is true of every Chriſtian, and of every Branch of Divinity; not <hi>Happy are ye if ye know theſe things,</hi> but <note n="*" place="margin">Joh XIII 17.</note> 
               <hi>if we know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſenſible much more might have been ſaid to this purpoſe, but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I only beg leave to draw two or three Inferences from this Diſcourſe, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is no hard matter from hence to diſcover, upon what occaſions the ſtudy of ſublime and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Points in Religion, is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and adviſeable. It is not to repoſe our Confidence in, as the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> of old did, who made great account of their boaſted Illuminations, though at the ſame time they allowed themſelves in the moſt beaſtly Impurities. It is not to expoſe or overthrow the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Chriſtian Faith; to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Differences, and blow the Coals of Contention, by forming Parties and Factions, as <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> do. It is not to feed our Vanity and Oſtentation, to play Prizes in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and make wanton Flouriſhes of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49873:21"/> Subtlety and Wit, as the <hi>School-men</hi> too often ſeem to have done. It is not to diſparage plain practical Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as if men were wiſer, when they chooſe to ſhew their Dexterity, by treading out new Paths, than when they travel in the beaten Road to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. It is not, in a word, from <hi>Choice,</hi> but from <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> that theſe things ſhould be labour'd in. And this is a Neceſſity, which conceited Smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, or crafty Enemies of Religion lay upon Some, to qualify themſelves for countermining them. For God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, that the <hi>Stewards of the Myſteries of Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſtand by tamely, and look on in ſilence, while they that hate the Truth are at work, to take away the Ground from under them, upon which their Faith and Hope are built. Theſe men muſt conſider the Charge committed to their Truſt, and be prepared, not only with Integrity and Zeal, but with Penetration and Skill. For the beſt Cauſe will ſuffer, if they who undertake it, are not provided with a juſt Defence; And this Defence cannot be made, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being Maſters of the ſame with their Adverſaries, that ſo they may
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49873:21"/> detect their falſe Reaſonings, put them out of their Play, and foil them at their own Weapon. It were, no doubt, much happier for You, and Us, and all the World, that we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to attend to, but only to perſwade our People to their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Duties, and explain to them the Methods, how they may beſt <hi>adorn the Doctrine of our God and Saviour in all things:</hi> Greatly to be wiſhed, that the differing Intereſts and Opinions of Chriſtians were ſo compoſed, as to leave no occaſion; Or, if that cannot be, yet that Petulant and Licentious Tongues and Pens were ſo effectually reſtrained, as never to give any juſt Provocation for ſuch Diſputes: For the leſs of theſe there is, the better to be ſure it is, not only for the Churches Peace, but for the Quiet and good Government of the State too. We muſt be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Arms, becauſe we are liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the publick Service; but we ſhall do well to remember, by whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion we act, and never uſe thoſe Arms, but when our Maſter's Honour and Religion are in Danger.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let me prevail on you for this moſt reaſonable Requeſt, That
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49873:22"/> from the Uncertainty of ſome abſtruſe Points in Religion, you <hi>would not make any Concluſions to the prejudice of Religion in general.</hi> Though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable Difficulties may lie on both ſides of ſome Queſtions, this does not hinder the Authority of eaſy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtable Truths. And, though Some, that enter the Liſts upon theſe Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, may lay about them madly, like Fencers in the dark, and cut and gaſh one another without Mercy; yet be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, there are ſuch Vertues, as Meekneſs and Chriſtian Charity in the World. It is a general Rule in all Arts and Sciences, to make thoſe things that are Plain, a Foundation and Introduction to thoſe that are Obſcure: But no where, I think, except in Religion, have men ever been ſo fantaſtical and abſurd, as to deny and caſt off all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to things that are Plain, for the ſake of thoſe that are Obſcure. This is juſt as if an undiſciplin'd Reader ſhould reject all <hi>Euclid</hi>'s Axioms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he finds himſelf unable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate every <hi>Propoſition</hi> in his Book. There is not any one of our pert Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters againſt <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> but would think it a Reproach
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49873:22"/> upon his underſtanding, to treat any other Author, at the rate he does the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Writers of Holy Scripture. When therefore men are looſen'd in their Principles of Religion, upon ſuch poor and frivolous accounts, as would not be allowed ſufficient to ſhake the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of any other Science (ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, as Learned Mens differing in their Judgment about ſome difficult Points of it) This is but too plain a Diſcovery, that ſomething elſe is caſt into the Scale, beſides the real Merits of the Cauſe: And that ſuch People cavil at Religion, not becauſe they have Reaſon to think it is not true; but becauſe they wiſh it were not, and apprehend it for their Eaſe and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that it ſhould not be, true.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I cannot upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, forbid my ſelf addreſſing to you, the Members of our eſtabliſhed Church in particular, moſt earneſtly beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, to <hi>conſider the Privileges you enjoy, and to make a right Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of them.</hi> You have not the Word of Truth lock'd up from you in an unknown Tongue, nor are prohibited to uſe it freely. You are permitted, entreated, commanded to

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49873:23"/> and Affections, which obſtruct Peace and Order, Charity and Juſtice. For be very confident, that He who lives beſt, does in the Chriſtian Senſe know moſt; And every one of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Parts and Induſtry may know enough for theſe purpoſes. <note n="*" place="margin">Micah.

               <hi>God hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> This is a ſhort and a plain Leſſon, and yet even this well learnt, would not fail to bring us all to Heaven.

            <p>GREAT part of this Epiſtle, and particularly this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is employ'd, in urging the Advantages theſe <hi>Epheſian's</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, by being converted to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; and the Improvements it was expected they ſhould make of them. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle adviſes them <note n="*" place="margin">Verſ. 8, 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>to walk as Children of Light, To prove what is the good and acceptable
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49873:25"/> Will of the Lord,</hi> and in order to their doing ſo, to ſhake hands with their old Corruptions, and <hi>have no Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In treating of theſe Words, I deſign to ſpeak to theſe four following Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
<list>
                  <item>I. I will ſhew, <hi>What thoſe things are, which the Apoſtle here commands us to avoid, under this detestable Title.</hi> The Works of Darkneſs.</item>
                  <item>II. <hi>What it is to</hi> have no fellowſhip with them.</item>
                  <item>III. I ſhall preſs the Reaſon <hi>for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Works, which the Text hath couched, by calling them</hi> unfruitful, and then</item>
                  <item>IV. <hi>I ſhall apply my ſelf from the whole, to the perſuading every one of us, to act like men duly convinc'd of the former Heads, and the Engagements that lie upon us with regard to them.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall ſhew, What thoſe things are, which the Apoſtle here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to avoid, under the deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Title, <hi>The works of Darkneſs.</hi> And here it is fit I put you in mind, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49873:25"/> all ſins indeed, of what nature or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſoever, are ſuch Works; and that we are abſolutely forbidden any kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for, and Intimacy with them all. For, whether by Darkneſs we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Ignorance and Error, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe Regions of horrour inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by Devils and damned Spirits, the Title will very properly belong to them in both reſpects. Every Sin is owing in ſome meaſure to a defect in the mind, and wrong Apprehenſions of things; Every one leads to thoſe diſmal Regions of Death; Every one derives it ſelf from the Prince of Darkneſs, and is originally his Work. But, becauſe even of ſins there are differences to be made, both as to the degree, and as to the malignity of them; ſince ſome do more manifeſtly carry the Character and Features of that old Serpent, whoſe Spawn they are; I will juſt mention ſome few, which ſeem by way of Eminence to challenge this Title. Now, Of Theſe Some were more peculiar to the Pagan World, and ſuch as St. <hi>Paul</hi> had an immediate reſpect to in this Chapter, particularly that Idolatrous and Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Worſhip, and all thoſe vain Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49873:26"/> which even the wiſeſt, and moſt Learned Heathens had ſubmitted themſelves to. And Others of them are ſuch, as do even now, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Light and Advantages of Chriſtianity, endanger mens Souls, and draw them into a Reſemblance of the Devil, whoſe qualities they are. Such eſpecially are Pride and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Envy and Malice, Lying and Diſſimulation, Faction and Treachery, and the Tempting others to Sin: For under theſe Qualities the Devil is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in Scripture, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh Nature of theſe Vices is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted, as ſoon as they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. So that without further enlarging upon ſo odious a Subject, I ſhall think my ſelf now at liberty to deſcend to my</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Second</hi> Particular, which was deſigned to enquire, <hi>What it is to have no fellowſhip with theſe works of Darkneſs.</hi> And here I can by no means think it proper, to put the avoiding the Commiſſion of the groſſeſt Sins, much leſs contracting the habits of them, into this account. For to call the Inſolent and Haughty, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable and Cenſorious, the Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and the Slanderer, the man that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49873:26"/> repines at Good, and triumphs in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and miſchief; that diſguiſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and deceives and betrays others; to call Him, I ſay, only a <hi>Partaker</hi> in Wickedneſs; To allow the zealous Advocates for Sin, and buſy Factors of the Devil, them who make it their Buſineſs to put Vertue and Religion out of Countenance, to corrupt all they converſe with, and carry on his Trade here upon Earth, I ſay, To al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch Wretches as theſe ſo gentle a Name, as men that <hi>have Fellowſhip</hi> with Works of Darkneſs; is to ſhew a great deal more Civility to Vice, than becomes us. This were to give too much Reputation to Sin, by ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the worſt of Practices, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting them to the World, under ſuch extenuating Terms. It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary the Works of Darkneſs ſhou'd have no Veil drawn before them, but be expos'd to the View of Mankind in their true Colours; and that every one ſhou'd be made throughly ſenſible, whoſe buſineſs he carries on, and what he is doing, and how great a guilt he contracts, when he indulges himſelf in any of thoſe Abominations. And therefore I ſhall now proceed to tell
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49873:27"/> you, what other Inſtances of forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking ſuch Corruptions the Apoſtle muſt in all reaſon be acknowledged to require here; and that none of us can anſwer the Character of <hi>Children of Light,</hi> unleſs, to the avoiding the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſuch Luſts in our own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, we do likewiſe add theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt, The declining, as much as may be, the Acquaintance and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Converſation of notorious and ſcandalouſly wicked men.</hi> The Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Sin is ſo rank and ſpreading, and we in ſo conſtant a Diſpoſition to receive it, that no Caution, when pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently us'd, can be too great in this Particular. <note n="*" place="margin">Ecclus. XIII. 1.</note> The Scriptures have compared vicious Company to <hi>Pitch upon the Clothes,</hi> and <note place="margin">Prov. VI. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Fire in the Boſom.</hi> And the general Cenſures, even of men diſcreet and tender, are apt to bring the Keepers of it under an odious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Which abundantly juſtifies the Compariſons; and argues the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conſent of Reaſon in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream danger of ſuch Converſation. The ſame Diſcoveries of our Love and Hatred, which Nature and Paſſion put us upon in Other Caſes,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49873:27"/> muſt be the Work of Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in This. And they who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly place themſelves in the way of Temptation, ſeem to have but a very imperfect Senſe of their own Frailties, or elſe not to have weaned their Inclinations ſufficiently from the Luſts they affect ſuch Familiarity with. For, when we cannot be perſonally intimate with the Devil himſelf, the next degree of Friendſhip we can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſhew for him, is to be fond of converſing with thoſe who are moſt like him themſelves, and whoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples naturally tend to make others like him too. What Philoſophers tell us of ſome Creatures, that they frequently change their Colour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Stones or Plants their Bodies reſt upon, muſt always be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by thinking Perſons to be a very lively Emblem of the minds of men. For theſe ever receive a ſtrong Tincture from the Perſons they frequent, and are inſenſibly form'd into Their Appetites and Opinions; Their Language and Their Manners. And therefore ſuch perſons muſt not think they are ill uſed, if both God and Good Men condemn thoſe approaches
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49873:28"/> to Sin, as ſure Arguments of a ſecret kindneſs for it, and ſad Preſages of a dying Zeal for the Honour of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their own Safety.</p>
            <p>Miſtake me not, I beſeech you, I am not here recommending ſuch a ſurper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious Pride, as we find the Phariſees upon all Occaſions guilty of, ſuch as ſhou'd teach men to diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the reſt of the World, with a <hi>Stand off, I am holier than Thou.</hi> No: The Deteſtation of other People's Vices muſt always be ſo temper'd, as not to produce a diſdain for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, nor may we ſo far conſider them as Sinners, as to forget that they are Men. All that I am now adviſing, is only the neceſſary Care for our own Preſervation; And, where the Offices of Charity, and the Courteſies of the World do not endanger our own Souls (as indeed they very ſeldom do, if managed with any competent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of diſcretion) there we have a pattern in our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf, who, for the ſake of doing good, was content to eat, and to drink with Harlots and Publicanes and Sinners.</p>
            <p>But ſtill That Example of His, and All that can be ſaid to ſupport and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49873:28"/> countenance the frequenting of bad Company, will never be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade holy and conſidering men, that they ought to mingle Friendſhips with all indifferently, and to keep no guard at all upon themſelves, in the midſt of a very crooked and perverſe Generation. It gives too much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Vice, to make it no part of our Averſion; and puts our own welfare upon too deſperate a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, to court that diſtemper, which if once caught, may end in Death eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. It ſhews, that we think very little of the horror of Sin, or the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creeping Qualities by which it ſteals into our Souls, when we are loath to be kept at a diſtance from it; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch poor pretences, as either the Forms of Civility, or a falſe Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our own Strength and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are us'd to furniſh us with, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to dwell within the reach of its Infection. This is in effect to throw dry Stubble into the Fire, to commit a Body full of ill Humours to the mercy of a raging Peſtilence; For ſuch in truth is the Venemous nature of all Vice, and in ſuch conſtant readineſs are our hearts to catch and ſuck it in.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:49873:29"/>
            <p>But yet the ſame Apoſtle, who forbids all <hi>fellowſhip with the works of darkneſs</hi> here, and all ſcandalous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the Vth of his 1ſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> was ſo ſenſible of the univerſal Corruption of that time and People, that he acknowledges, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void vicious Company altogether, a Man muſt even go out of the World. And therefore, ſince the Tares and Wheat muſt ſtand together till the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Harveſt, and the condition of the preſent Life does of neceſſity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr a mixture of Good and bad men in the ſame common Field of the Church; After the due Care already mention'd to preſerve our ſelves from being tainted by this mixture, The Next thing I preſume neceſſary, and imply'd in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Command here, is This,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>thoſe perſons, who cannot be wholly declin'd, may never be approved, or have their wickedneſs favoured by us.</hi> After a long Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Abominations of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then World, this is added as a very high Aggravation of all the reſt, <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. I. 32.</note> 
               <hi>That they who knew the Judgments of God, and how worthy of death the Committers
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49873:29"/> of ſuch things were, not only did the ſame, but conſented with or took plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in thoſe that did them.</hi> This was an Argument, that when ſuch men ſinned, it was not ſo much through the ſtrength of paſſion, and the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of an over-bearing Temptation; as out of a ſetled and fixed Judgment, that had debauched their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and reconciled them to the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt unnatural Offences. And however we may, for ſome ſecret Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, endeavour to avoid the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Habits of Vice in our own Perſons; yet if we can, with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Complacency, behold the ſame thing in another, there cannot be a ſhrewder ſign, that our Averſions to ſin are not ſo ſtrong, nor ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſo true and ſound Principles as they ſhould be. For a juſt Senſe of Chriſtianity will beget in us a perfect Antipathy to Sin, wherever we find it; and to profeſs a hatred of it in our own caſe, and yet be very well reconcil'd to it in another Man's; to ſee it acted with Satisfaction, or hear it related with Reliſh and Delight, does certainly betray a hidden Reſerve of Kindneſs in its favour, and that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49873:30"/> our Underſtandings are either but ill convinc'd, or elſe we perverted and byaſs'd in our Affections concerning it.</p>
            <p>This Zeal for God and goodneſs, and indignation againſt evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Practices, is ſo conſiderable an Ingredient in a Holy Man's Character, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> has left it upon Record, as an eminent Commendation of juſt <hi>Lot</hi>'s Righteouſneſs; That <hi>he was afflicted continually with the filthy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the Wicked. For</hi> (ſays he) <note n="*" place="margin">2 Epiſt. 3. c. v. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>That righteous man dwelling among them in ſeeing and hearing, vexed his righteous ſoul, from day to day, with their unlawful deeds.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes of himſelf, <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> 
               <hi>It grieveth me when I ſee the Tranſgreſſors;</hi> and again, <hi>Mine eyes guſh out with water, becauſe men keep not thy Law.</hi> And indeed, if the common Rules of Honour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the vindicating of a Friend's Reputation, the men who pretend to govern themſelves by thoſe Rules, wou'd do well to remember how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming it is, patiently to ſee God and Religion, the beſt Friends and the beſt things abus'd and traduc'd; How tame and cold this argues all that profeſs Love, or Value for either.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49873:30"/> Now the open and ſhameleſs Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mens Lives are the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to both. He that keeps himſelf from this, may be allowed prudent and tender of his own Reputation; but if he gives it any countenance in another, he muſt not be eſteemed truly religious. For a zealous and good Conſcience can never be Friends with Wickedneſs, nor pleas'd with it at any rate, nor endure it with eaſe on any account, or in any perſon whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As a manifeſt Proof, that the <hi>works of darkneſs</hi> have no countenance from us, I think it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of our Duty, <hi>to Rebuke them, when that can be properly done.</hi> I add this neceſſary Limitation, <hi>when that can be properly done,</hi> becauſe there is no one good Office either of a Friend, or a Chriſtian, that requires more cautious and deliberate proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than This of Admonition and Reproof. It is not the buſineſs of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man, nor of every Time, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires fit Perſons, and favourable Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and is attended with a thouſand Niceties, which, if not punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, may defeat the beſt Intentions,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49873:31"/> and render the kindeſt Advices, not only Ineffectual, but Offenſive too. For, tho' Chriſtianity require this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary check upon Vice, yet it no where obliges any body to break through the Rules of Civility and Prudence; It preſerves all thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects entire, which muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon the different Orders, and Conditions of men in the World: It gives no Licence to Sawcineſs, and Ill Manners, under the pretence of holy Indignation, and Zeal. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when I urge the rebuking theſe <hi>works of darkneſs,</hi> as a Teſtimony of our <hi>having no fellowſhip with them,</hi> All thoſe Qualifications are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, which may make ſuch Rebukes, both becoming, and ſucceſsful. And though we are diſpens'd with, for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that <hi>which is holy to the dogs,</hi> That is Our good Advice to ſuch as we have cauſe to believe will <hi>trample it under foot, and turn again and rent us;</hi> yet where Authority and Opportunity call upon us, where any hope of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing to a better Reformation ſhews it ſelf; there we muſt not think our ſelves at liberty, ſo much as to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Not to diſlike, is then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49873:31"/> and approve: And God, and Truth, and Vertue, have all a right to our Vindication of them. And ſure the leaſt we can poſſibly do, is not to contribute to the diſgrace of thoſe things, that ſhou'd be (and to every good man are) beyond compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, the deareſt of any in the World.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To diſclaim <hi>fellowſhip with the works of darkneſs,</hi> effectually, <hi>we muſt avoid all occaſions of, and Tendencies towards them.</hi> There are infinite Accidents in a Man's Life, in which many things may offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though not ſtrictly Unlawful, yet exceeding Dangerous to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with. Such are a number of thoſe that naturally occurr in the matters of Temperance, and Chaſtity; and in All other Caſes, where the queſtion concerns the indulging ſuch Paſſions, and Deſires, and Pleaſures, as are not in their own nature ſinful; but only offend, according to the meaſures, or ſome other Circumſtances, that attend the gratifying of them. Now the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of People on theſe Occaſions, are willing to give themſelves all the liberty that poſſibly they can; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49873:32"/> chooſe to hazard the falling into ſomething that ſhou'd not be done, than to abridge themſelves of any thing that may be done. But This is perhaps one of the moſt deſtructive Courſes in the World; And the more ſo, becauſes it impoſes' upon many ſeemingly good perſons in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of themſelves; and is apt to perſuade them all muſt needs be well, ſo long as they can take Sanctuary in this Teſtimony of their Conſciences, that they do not allow themſelves in any thing, which is poſitively and in its own nature ſinful. But alaſs! They who conſider the Conſtitution of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and the ſubtle Methods of our Tempting Adverſary; by what an eaſy deſcent we are carried down to Hell; how gentle and inſiuating the Allurements and Steps to Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are; and how inſenſibly the Fort of our Souls is betray'd, when the Pleaſures of Senſe have laid Reaſon to ſleep, when the Spirits flow gayly, and the Guards of ſevere Thoughts, and ſtrict Religion are over-powered by them; (all which happens even in the moſt lawful Enjoyments ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) They who obſerve theſe things,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49873:32"/> I ſay, Theſe wiſe and good men will ſoon diſcern the neceſſity of Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial; how convenient it is to exerciſe that Virtue betimes, and not to give our ſelves the utmoſt ſtretch we may. For certainly it becomes every man that is ſerious in the Buſineſs of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be as ſafe as poſſibly he can: Not only to ruine himſelf, but to be upon his guard againſt all Hazards of Ruine. And it was not a hard, but a prudent and needful Commandment, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> has left us; <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. V. 22.</note> to <hi>abſtain from the very appearance of Evil.</hi> They who profeſs to hate the thing it ſelf, and to repent of it, and to forſake it; and yet wou'd fain be doing what looks like it, and leads to it, cannot eſcape this Cenſure at leaſt, of <hi>being Lovers of pleaſure more than Lovers of God.</hi> This comes from a perpetual hankering after their Luſts, and ſhews that they wou'd fain accommodate the matter between Chriſt and the Devil. They endeavour to divide themſelves as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually as may be, Not to be wicked for fear of danger, but yet to be as near wicked as they can too, for Love of Pleaſure. And like treacherous and poor-ſpirited men, who in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49873:33"/> Title, act for one Prince to ſerve their own Ends, and are ſecretly in the Intereſts of another to humour their Inclination; ſo theſe men carry it between Vertue and Vice. They have a ſecret Affection for the one; and yet they muſt ſtifle this Affection, becauſe it cannot be to their advantage to own and purſue it publickly. But ſtill their hearts are ever treacherous, ever bending to the wrong ſide; and the bottom of all their pretended Quarrel with Sin, is not ſo Much for its being <hi>a Work of Darkneſs,</hi> as for its being an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfruitful Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Fifthly and Laſtly;</hi> The thing, which contains, and which muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all the reſt, is what the Apoſtle urges in the End of this Verſe, <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe Works:</hi> I mean by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Tenure of a pious and exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Converſation. For that is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof he means there. The expoſing them by this means to the World, and diſcovering all the Horrour and Deformity of them. The Shortneſs of our Capacities, and the intricate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of things make it neceſſary for us, to advance in Knowledge by the help of Compariſons; And the quickeſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49873:33"/> way to it, is by ſetting Oppoſite Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities before our eyes at once to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template both, and ſo to diſcern the difference between them. Now as none are more Contrary, ſo none do more manifeſtly illuſtrate each other, than Vertue and Vice; which are therefore very elegantly repreſented by the Apoſtle here, under the two moſt diſtant and irreconcilable Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs.</hi> But all the Life, and Efficacy of this Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation depends upon the Practice. It is not a plauſible declaiming againſt the One, nor the moſt elegant Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue in Praiſe of the Other, that can ſufficiently recommend This, or condemn That. Becauſe, though the Characters be never ſo juſt, yet Words are but matter of form, and may be employed upon any ſubject, for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reſpects, contrary to the inward and real Senſe of the Speaker. But the Eſteem which comes to Religion by a good Life cannot be counterfeit. Theſe Actions of a Man prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſhew the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs upon the Soul. And in ſuch a Caſe, none is ſo blind, but he ſees the Beauties of Holineſs; how it ſhines
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49873:34"/> and ſheds its Rays like the Sun; not only to the delight, but the benefit and warmth of all that are within the Sphere of its Activity; What a foil the contrary Vices are to it, how black and diſmal, how ugly and crooked they look, when brought to this Light; and ſet againſt the ſtreight and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, the ſweet and charming Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of Religion. This comes home to the meaneſt Underſtandings, and ſupplies the place of all the Eloquence in the World. It convinces where nothing elſe can enter; It is a ſort of mechanical Reaſon, without the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Methods of Rhetorick and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; and will not fail to draw, where thoſe cannot ſo much as move. This is therefore the peculiar advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a holy Life, to check and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance Sin; to ſhew it in its true and worſt Colours, and not only to receive Luſtre from, but to reflect it back again upon Vertue and Religion.</p>
            <p>From what has been delivered in theſe Particulars, we ſee the true extent of the Apoſtle's Command, and our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with regard to it; How falſe thoſe men are to God and Religion, who content themſelves with avoiding the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49873:34"/> groſſeſt and fouleſt Offences, if in the mean while they indulge their Luſts, and expoſe their Souls to the Snares of evil Company; If they retain any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Fondneſs for Sin, and can ſo much as with eaſe or patience, ſee or hear what is ſo; If they are ſo tame and cold in the Cauſe of God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as not boldly and ſharply to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke Vice, where that can be prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſeaſonably done; If they ſtill halt between Vertue and Vice, and are ſo fond of the thing, as to ſport upon the very confines of it; and ſhew that their proceeding no further, is more the effect of Intereſt, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, than ſincere Piety and Choice; and laſtly, If their Example do any way countenance it, and not rather diſplay its Deformity, and deceitful Diſguiſes; and, by repreſenting God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in all its Luſtre, render that more inviting, and lovely; and Sin more odious to the World. Thoſe who do not endeavour all this are not entirely devoted to Chriſt, nor true Children of Light; but have ſtill a Tenderneſs for, and hold a private Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with <hi>the Works of Darkneſs.</hi> And how deſtructive ſuch double
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49873:35"/> dealing will be in the End, how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable our Averſions to thoſe Works are, and all, even the moſt ſevere, proofs, that can be required to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the truth of our Hatred, and to make good our Engagements againſt them; I hope will ſoon appear to you, by a brief conſideration of my Third Particular, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p n="3">III. The reaſon of avoiding theſe <hi>works of Darkneſs,</hi> which the Text hath couched here, by calling them <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfruitful.</hi> It is not without great Elegance, and particular good reaſons, that the Luſts and Practices of Sinners are ſo frequently in Scripture ſtyl'd <hi>Works;</hi> for This implies the Toil and Drudgery of them, and intimates to us, what ſad experience wou'd teach too late, that no man can be very wicked, without much Labour, and great Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The diſtracting Cares and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Ambition and Covetouſneſs; the Violence and Tyranny of raging Paſſions, and inordinate Deſires; which hurry men into Anger, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and Injuſtice, and Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all manner of Exceſs, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be inconſiſtent with eaſe and pleaſure. For they impoſe more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49873:35"/> Tasks upon a man, and put him upon more dangerous, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Attempts, than the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Tyrant, or the Crueleſt Enemy, cou'd invent for his Captive, or his Slave. And he that has once reſign'd up the Government of himſelf to the furious and wild Suggeſtions of the Tempter, and his own rebellious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, muſt make no more Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to Freedom and Satisfaction; He has bid adieu to all that can give him any, and does in the higheſt ſenſe of the words verify our Lord's obſervation. <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. VIII. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Whoſoever committeth Sin is the Servant of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how hard a ſervice that muſt needs be, I leave every one to judge, when he finds it deſcrib'd <note n="*" place="margin">Wiſd. V. 7. Jerem. IX. 5. Habak. II. 13.</note> 
               <hi>by a dark and ſlippery path; by mens wearying themſelves to work iniquity, walking through dangerous places; and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the very fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ſuch then be the Pains and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſomneſs; If ſuch the Hazards and Difficulties, that attend the <hi>Work,</hi> it will become us very ſeriouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what it is we lay our ſelves out upon; and whether the Profits will at laſt anſwer the trouble: And of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49873:36"/> This too, the Scriptures give us a true, but a lamentable account; <note n="*" place="margin">Habak. II. 13. Iſaiah LV. 2</note> by aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us, that ſuch men <hi>weary them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for vanity, and a thing of nought,</hi> that they <hi>ſpend their labour for that which ſatisfieth not; that their years are conſumed in trouble; and all their works unfruitful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what a miſerable thing is this now? For a man to look back upon a life, ſo ill, ſo uneaſily ſpent; and find it turn to no advantage at all? To reflect what crooked and rough paths he has travelled through, what a deal of Sweat and Strength it has coſt him, to obey the Commands of a Maſter, who will never conſider him for his pains? How often his mind has been tortured and perplexed with unlawful deſires, and anxious fears; How he has been rackt to gratify his Luſt, or his Pride, his Avarice or Revenge; How he has ſacrificed all his content and calmneſs of mind, all his reſt and quiet enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf and the world to theſe Paſſions; and when he comes at laſt to ſit down, and Compute his gains, to find that all his hopes have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, and all his Labours vain; And, inſtead of ſuch a Summ as might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49873:36"/> his paſt ſufferings, to find that Sarcaſm of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s underwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at the foot of the Account; and his conſcience, after being long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded with the expectations of I know not what imaginary Happineſs, turn again upon him with a <note n="*" place="margin">Rom.

            <p>And now, after this account of the Sinners Recompence for all his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Trouble, there cannot, one would think, need any long Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to perſwade us to act, like perſons ſenſible of what has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready delivered under the foregoing heads, and of our engagements with regard to them. Which was the IVth and laſt thing I propoſed, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49873:37"/> that I ſhall diſpatch as briefly as may be.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Now That which I ſhall draw from the <hi>firſt</hi> head, and the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the <hi>Works of Darkneſs,</hi> is, <hi>The Reaſonableneſs of our being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly well ſatisfied with our Duty, and heartily thankful for the benefits of the Goſpel.</hi> For the more we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> of thoſe Ages in which our Fore-fathers lived, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we ſhall diſcern the happineſs of our own. When men, advanced ſo far in Wiſdom and Vertue, ſuch as <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> and ſome others, whom Antiquity always names with reſpect and admiration, had yet the misfortune of great Errours both in their Judgment and Practice; This is a manifeſt Evidence, how neceſſary ſome farther Revelation of the Divine Will was to mankind, how unable Nature and Reaſon are, even when moſt refin'd and improv'd, to diſcover all thoſe Rules, which are requiſite for the due Government of our ſelves. And all this contributes to the illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God's mercies to Chriſtians ſo much the more, when the things that were then unſearchable, are now ſo
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49873:38"/> clear and plain, that even <hi>Babes</hi> may apprehend, and <hi>He that runs may read them.</hi> All the Diſguiſes of Vice are now pulled off, its natural Deformities laid bare, its abſurdity and Inconſiſtence with the Chriſtian's Principles demonſtrated, its wretched Conſequences plainly forewarn'd. The Beauties of Vertue, and all its engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Advantages are fairly ſet before us; And nothing now is wanting, that can in reaſon be deſired, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince our Judgments, or to charm our Affections. All which muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly perſwade us, that the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thoſe men muſt needs be very Juſt, muſt needs be very Great, who do not rejoice in this <hi>Light,</hi> and uſe it ſincerely; Who do not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the performance of what is ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the dignity of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo ſecure of leading them in the beſt way to happineſs, ſo eaſy, and ſo delightful; with a <hi>Contented</hi> ſhall I ſay? No, that's too little, and too low a Character; but with a <hi>Chearful,</hi> and a <hi>Thankful,</hi> mind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Second</hi> head, which explained what Teſtimonies are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of our <hi>having no Fellowſhip with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49873:38"/> the Works of Darkneſs,</hi> I wou'd urge in general a <hi>Continual Watch, and holy Jealouſy over our ſelves.</hi> Where every complyance with Sin is not only Diſobedience, but Treachery; and where the Danger, and the Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſuch offences incur, are ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, no care can be enough. And if we wou'd but once be made ſenſible, how Cunning our great Enemy of Souls is, to turn every thing into an occaſion of Sin; We ſhou'd walk like men in the midſt of Traps and Snares, or upon Rocks and narrow Precipices. There is no truſting of our ſelves too near the Cockatrices Den; no playing upon the hole of the Aſp, if we expect to be ſafe; the beſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is keeping at a diſtance, that we may have leiſure to look about us; and either flee betimes, and eſcape the Temptation; or be prepared for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting it, when it ſhall overtake us. But whatever it is that leads into Sin, or has by experience been already found to endanger our falling into it; The man who indulges himſelf in that thing, ſets open the door, and invites the Devil to come in; He awakens and aſſiſts the wicked Spirit
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49873:39"/> againſt himſelf; and is ſo perverſely officious in his own ruine, that this man does in a manner Tempt the very Tempter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But <hi>Thirdly;</hi> my Laſt particular enforces both the other Inferences, For the more Juſt, to be ſure, are our Thanks and Joy for being delivered from <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> the more Neceſſary and Reaſonable our exceeding great Care to avoid the <hi>works</hi> of it, if thoſe works are, as I have ſhew'd them to be, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfruitful.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all I ſhall add upon this head, is what the Prophet call'd upon the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo earneſtly for. <note n="*" place="margin">Iſaiah XLVI. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Remember this and ſhew your ſelves men; bring it again to mind O ye Tranſgreſſors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be not ſo raſh and giddy, but allow your ſelves the benefit of a Second thought. Conſider what is to be propos'd from Sin, before you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it; Think, O think betimes, how ſhort, how poor, how low, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing Pleaſures of it are; The Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Senſe for a moment, or the imperfect and uncertain enjoyment of things which no man can promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the continuance of, no not an hour. A <hi>Laughter</hi> it may be indeed,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49873:39"/> but a Laughter in <hi>the midst of which the heart is ſorrowful;</hi> and a Taſt of Honey in the mouth, ſure to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Gall in the Stomach. And when you have weighed all theſe in a juſt ballance, and paſs'd a true and impartial Eſtimate upon them, you will then confeſs them at the beſt but Unprofitable and Vain, and that they who ſell themſelves to work wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>ſell themſelves for nought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſtill they <hi>ſell themſelves;</hi> (if that can be a proper term, where no price is paid) that is, They part with that propriety and government God and nature have given them, to every eager and enticing Luſt; to every trifle of a Temptation; nay to the Enemy of mankind, to be <hi>taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and diſpos'd of <hi>at his Will.</hi> They caſt away their Soul, the nobleſt work of God's hand here below; on which he has ſtampt his Image, and made it immortal. That Jewel of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable worth, <note place="margin">Matth. XVI. 26.</note> which the <hi>whole world</hi> is too cheap an Exchange for, and was therefore thought worthy the purchaſe of the blood of God himſelf. And muſt theſe Treaſures be ſo laviſhly ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered away? Muſt what has once coſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49873:40"/> ſo dear, be alienated for no benefit, no Conſideration at all? None did I ſay? moſt happy were it if there were none. <hi>Bring it again to mind, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore O ye Tranſgreſſors.</hi> Sit down and ask your ſelves, whether you wou'd be content to give your perſons away for ſo little, to the perplexity of falſe Hopes, and immoderate Deſires, and confounding Fears; to the Miſgivings of Guilt, and the amazing Agonies of a wounded Conſcience; to forced Diſeaſes and untimely Deaths; to the Horrours of Deſpair at your Laſt hour, and when that hour is paſt, to certain and eternal Damnation; the Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a God never to be appeaſed, and the Torments of a fire never to be quenched. <hi>Remember this therefore O ye Tranſgreſſors, and ſhew your ſelves men;</hi> for Otherwiſe you cannot be Men. While you purſue Death, and court Sorrow and Ruine; while for a Dream, a Shadow, a mere Nothing, You are even pleaſed to throw away the moſt precious Subſtance in the world, you quite unman your ſelves, and forfeit all pretenſions to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of reaſonable Creatures.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:49873:40"/>
            <p>Good God! How ſtrange, and yet how common is this Infatuation! that carries men thus away, in deſpight of all reaſon, in deſpight of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and (which in other Caſes ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fails to moves us) in deſpight of all Intereſt too to the Contrary. Let us at laſt (my Brethren) think it high time to recover our Souls from this ſtrong Poſſeſſion, to reſtore our ſelves to Conſideration and Thought, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon our Advantages, and act for the future as becomes Men. Men that are thankful for God's mercies, deſirous to anſwer the intent of them to our ſelves, zealous for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and our own benefit; mindful of our moſt reaſonable Engagements; and therefore moſt reaſonable, becauſe they bind us to forſake ſuch <hi>works</hi> only as are <hi>unfruitful.</hi> And in order to this, we ſhall do well to add our Prayers to our Reſolutions and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and continually to beg God's aſſiſtance, as the Church has inſtructed us to do in her Collect for the 3d <hi>Sunday</hi> after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> with which I conclude this Diſcourſe.</p>

            <p>MY Text is part of a Parable, made uſe of by our Bleſſed Saviour to illuſtrate that Saying, <note place="margin">Ch. XIX. 30.</note> which concludes the Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49873:42"/> and is again repeated in This Chapter. <note place="margin">XX. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Many that are firſt ſhall be laſt; and the laſt ſhall be firſt.</hi> By which is ſignified the Method, by which God thinks fit to proceed, in impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mankind the Advantages and Rewards of the Goſpel. And the Image our Lord chooſes to repreſent it by is This.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 1.</note> A Maſter of a Family is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed uſing great diligence to <hi>hire Labourers into his Vineyard,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them into his Service at different times of the Day. <note place="margin">Verſ. 2.</note> With thoſe who were received early he makes a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Agreement for a determinate Summ. <note place="margin">Verſ. 4. 7.</note> To the Reſt, who went in later, he promiſes in general Terms, a Reward reaſonable and fit for them. <note place="margin">Verſ. 8.</note> In the Evening, when theſe Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were brought together to receive their Wages, They who had wrought but a little while, were firſt called; and had at much given them, as Thoſe who laboured the whole Day had covehanted for. This raiſed the Expectations of the Early Workman, not doubting, but a Maſter ſo boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful for the Service of One, or but a Few hours, would not fail in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49873:42"/> to advance Their Wages too. But, to their great Aſtoniſhment and Indignation, the Steward is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to let them have their juſt Hire, and no more. And the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made to theſe two ſorts of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, ſo diſtant from what they both looked for, is what the Words now read take expreſs notice of. <hi>When they came who were hired about the Eleventh hour,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Scope and End of this whole Similitude ſeems to be Two-fold, <hi>viz. To check the Vanity of Some who may value themſelves upon having been long in the Vineyard; and To encourage and ſuſtain Others who might entertain but feeble hopes of Recompence, from their being called in at the latter end of the Day.</hi> Such Paſſages therefore, as ſtrictly anſwer this End are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and neceſſary parts of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and ought to be ſtrictly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to. The reſt we need not be very nice about, but may conſider them only as Circumſtances, inſerted to make the Reſemblance more beautiful and moving. The Applications of this Parable, muſt likewiſe be ſuited to the main deſign of it: and the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49873:43"/> Doctrines deduced from thence ſuch as carry an exact agreement with, and are the natural Reſult of, that Deſign. Of theſe the Principal ſeem to lye within the compaſs of my Text, which propounds to our Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Justice</hi> and the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, in rewarding his Servants under the Goſpel-Covenant. <hi>Mercy</hi> to Them, who receive <hi>the Penny,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were hired but <hi>at the Eleventh hour:</hi> Yet this, without any deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his <hi>Juſtice</hi> towards them who receive no more, notwithſtanding they came into the Work ſooner.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Points I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to treat of from the Words. And in order hereunto, it will only be needful to premiſe, that by <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven</hi> I underſtand the dealings of God with Mankind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Chriſtian Diſpenſation. Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to the Faith and Obedience of his Bleſſed Son, who rules in our hearts and adminiſters the Kingdom of Grace here; and rewarding that Faith and Obedience in Heaven, where he ſhall reign in the Kingdom of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hereafter. So that by the Wages, or the <hi>Penny</hi> is chiefly meant that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49873:43"/> Eternal Happineſs awarded to Good men in the next World; Not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding but implying, in Subordination to that future Recompence, all the Benefits and Privileges of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, which lead on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that Triumphant State, while as yet the Church is Militant in this World.</p>
            <p>There are but Two ſorts of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation neceſſary to be taken notice of; becauſe all the reſt, which Learned men have thought upon, will, I think, either be comprehended under theſe, or may, by Parity of Reaſon, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from them.

                     <hi>The</hi> Second <hi>brings it home to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Christians; and accommodates this whole Matter to the Age of Man, and the ſeveral Stages of our Lives.</hi>

            <p>Now to render my preſent Diſcourſe as full and ſatisfactory as I am able, I ſhall take in both theſe Senſes; and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49873:44"/> will endeavour to ſhew, that the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every <hi>Labourer a Penny;</hi> that is, making the <hi>Gentiles</hi> equal with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>late Penitents</hi> equal with more <hi>early Converts,</hi> as this Parable, when duly obſerved, repreſents the matter to us; that theſe Proceedings, I ſay, are neither of them any juſt Reflection upon the Righteouſneſs of God, and that his Bounty and Mercy are eminently magnified in Both.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>I begin with his Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some by the ſeveral Hours mentioned here, have underſtood the ſeveral Ages of the World. So as that <hi>Hiring Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers early in the Morning</hi> ſhould allude to the Revelations God made of himſelf to the Fathers before the Floud. The <hi>Third hour,</hi> to his calling <hi>Abraham</hi> and the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> out of the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Idolatry. The <hi>Sixth</hi> to the Inſtitution of the Law promulged by <hi>Moſes.</hi> The <hi>Ninth</hi> to the Prophetick Age. And the <hi>Eleventh</hi> or Cloſe of the Day, to That diſpenſation, which is the Laſt men are ever to expect, the Goſpel of Chriſt. But theſe are Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties, upon which no great Streſs need be laid. For all our Saviour ſeems to have intended by diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49873:44"/> the time after this manner, is only to expreſs himſelf according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Who began to reckon their Day from Sun-riſing, and parcell'd out the Whole into Four Watches or Diviſions: At the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Three of theſe, and once more at the laſt hour, the Lord of the Vineyard renews his Call, and takes in as many as were ready, and willing to come.</p>
            <p>By This, no doubt, we are given to underſtand, that God has done all that became him toward men's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. He called when he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no obligation; He ſought Them who enquired not after Him; He did not only go out early to ſeek them; but he repeated his Invitations. And, though the Excuſe made at the Sixth Verſe is not expreſly refuted, nor were they who urged it rejected, yet we cannot certainly infer, that this was admitted as a juſt and ſufficient Plea. They of the <hi>Eleventh hour</hi> were indeed <hi>idle, becauſe no man had hired them;</hi> but ſtill, might it not be their own fault, that they were not hired ſooner? For the ſame Maſter went out to ſeek them before; He
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49873:45"/> came to the <hi>Marker,</hi> the place whither Labourers uſually reſorted, and where they ought to have been ready to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves; and as many as were then preſent, and did accept his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he kindly retained. So that this Paſſage ſeems to ſtop the mouths, not of <hi>Jews</hi> only, but of all pretended Chriſtians too, who complain, that they want means and opportunities for becoming the men they ought to be. For this delay is very often too manifeſtly their own Fault. Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities have been put into their hands, and let ſlip through their own Sloth and Negligence. The Lord of the Vineyard ſought them ſooner, but they were not found. And in this caſe, the Blame will return at laſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own want of Care, and of more early Preparation. For had thoſe who came in at the <hi>Sixth,</hi> and <hi>Ninth,</hi> and <hi>Eleventh</hi> hours, been there at the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Third,</hi> we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think they had been hired then; At leaſt they had done their parts. But nothing leſs than being up at the earlieſt hour can acquit them from the Imputation of Idle and Sluggiſh Servants.</p>
            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:49873:45"/>
            <p>Not but that God does herein differ greatly from any Maſter of a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, that his Bounty and Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are infinitely greater, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Himſelf alone. <note place="margin">Iſa. XXX. 18.</note> He <hi>waits over men's Souls continually to do them good:</hi> He does not only call, but he diſpoſes our minds to hearken to, and comply with that Call; and in his merciful Providence times his Calls ſo, that they ſhall be repeated at Seaſons moſt favourable, and when we are beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to obey them. Theſe are the Methods of his abundant Grace, and as ſuch they are to be received. For, as thoſe <hi>Labourers</hi> could have no juſt complaint againſt the <hi>Houſholder,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him to have gone but once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Market,</hi> becauſe it was their duty to have been ready then; but it was great kindneſs to employ them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: So, when Almighty God hath once made ſufficient tenders of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and we have neglected them; if we periſh, the Fault is our own. But if, notwithſtanding our Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and unprepared hearts, thoſe Offers be repeated to us again and again: This is not Debt but Favour; not an act of Juſtice, but the free
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49873:46"/> Effect of his unſpeakable and exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>Thus much however muſt in reaſon be allowed, that the more Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of this kind have been formerly let go, and the more voluntary thoſe Neglects have been, the greater muſt the Condemnation of thoſe men needs be, who have ſtood out againſt them, or not put themſelves in the way of them before: And the greater is the Mercy, which admits ſuch into Grace at the laſt Call, and paſſes by all their former Contempts. And yet This will moſt aſſuredly be done upon their Complyance even then. For God does by no means intend to mock men by any of his Invitations, He makes them with a kind intent, He conſiders, more exactly than we are capable of doing, what advantages each perſon hath had, and what he hath wanted; what Hindrances have kept him off ſo long; and why One Call is more ſucceſsful than Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>We may ſay then with great Truth, concerning theſe Spiritual Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, what <hi>David</hi> did of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in our Temporal Affairs, that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49873:46"/>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. XXXVI. 6.</note> 
               <hi>his Goodneſs ſtandeth like the ſtrong Mountains.</hi> This is highly exalted, and eminently viſible to all the world: but <hi>his Judgments are like the great Deep:</hi> Vaſt and Dark, and ſuch as Mortal Eyes cannot ſee through. Yet is not this Depth ſo abſolutely impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable neither, but that we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo far into it as is neceſſary for our preſent purpoſe. We may know enough to juſtify God in his Dealings, though we cannot go to the bottom of his infinitely Wiſe and Myſterious Counſels. And therefore, having ſhewed the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God's receiving any manner of men into his Vineyard and Pay.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>I come now to conſider the Juſtice of his making Them equal in the wages, who are thus unequally received into the Work.</hi> Which indeed is the only Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in the Caſe. For we do not find the Goodneſs of this <hi>Houſholder</hi> ever brought in queſtion: So far from That, that the Exceſs of it was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned injurious: And the <hi>Firſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers</hi> thought their Maſter <hi>evil</hi> and hard upon Them, becauſe he was ſo bountiful, ſo ſeemingly Over-good, to thoſe who came into the Vineyard laſt.</p>
            <pb n="76" facs="tcp:49873:47"/>
            <p>Now in order to our better diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter, we will briefly ſtate the Difference between theſe ſorts of Labourers in the Parable, according to the Applications uſually made of it; and then examine what account can be given of this ſurpriſing diſtribution of Rewards in their ſeveral Caſes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> bear proportion to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers hired early,</hi> for They had long ſubmitted to a Religion inſtituted by God, a Law clogg'd with rigorous Ordinances, and very troubleſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations. In this reſpect they might truly be ſaid to <note place="margin">Verſ. 12.</note> 
               <hi>have born the burden and heat of the Day.</hi> But the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had wrought their own Wills, lived all along in Ignorance and Idolatry, Luxury and Laſciviouſneſs, and yet Theſe too had the tenders of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel and Eternal Life made to them. And as many as embraced thoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers were veſted in a Title to the Kingdom of Heaven; A Title equal with thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> who had lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſevere confinement, and born the heavy Yoke of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>So again. The Apoſtles and firſt Chriſtians came in to the Goſpel at
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49873:47"/> their utmoſt peril and expence. Their Fortunes, their Fame, their Liberties, their Lives, were the purchaſe paid for their Faith. And yet the ſame Kingdom of Heaven is opened for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Believers of all After-ages: though the times they live in be peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the Encouragements to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity ſecular, and all the heat of publick Perſecution extinct and over.</p>
            <p>Thus as to particular Perſons. Some are <hi>trained up</hi> from Children <note place="margin">Prov. XXII. 6.</note> 
               <hi>in the way they ſhould go, and when they are old, they do not depart from it.</hi> They conquer and quench the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar heats of Youth and Paſſion betimes, and, as much as the frailty of humane nature will allow, <note place="margin">Jam. I. 27.</note> do <hi>keep themſelves unſpotted from the world.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. XI. 9. XII. 1.</note> Others <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and let their heart chear them in their Youth, they walk in the ways of their own heart, and in the ſight of their own Eyes, till the Evil days come, and the Years in which they can no longer have pleaſure;</hi> and yet if even then they <hi>remember their Creator</hi> he ſhews himſelf <note place="margin">Joel II. 12.</note> 
               <hi>merciful and gracious, ſlow to anger and of great Goodneſs;</hi> And though it be late, yet if it be ſincerely and effectually, that they come back
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49873:48"/> to their duty, he opens his arms wide to embrace the returning Prodigals, pardons their long diſobedience, ſaves their Souls, and beſtows upon them a Glorious and Eternal Recompence.</p>
            <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> (which proceeds upon the ſame meaſures) They who have their Days ſhortned, and are cut off in the midſt of their Age, if they dye in Innocence, or in early and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing Vertue, are entitled to Happineſs, in common with Others, who live long, and glorify God by much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Suffering, and through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Tryals, and great Hardſhips, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at laſt into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſeveral Caſes the Importance of the Parable may very reaſonably be extended to; and I muſt try now to reconcile thoſe Doubts, which ſo great a Diſproportion of Perſons and Circumſtances may be apt to ſuggeſt to us: and muſt ſhew, if I can, that whatever we may think of the matter, ſtill the Judge of all the Earth in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this <hi>penny</hi> to each of them, does nothing but right. And throughout this whole Diſquiſition I ſhall make uſe chiefly, if not altogether, of ſuch
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49873:48"/> Arguments, as the Parable it ſelf fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes either plain ground for, or at leaſt very fair Intimations of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Now, <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſome difference taken notice of in the Parable, <hi>between theſe Labourers themſelves;</hi> and that, partly <hi>before,</hi> and partly <hi>after</hi> their work. The <hi>Firſt</hi> drove a poſitive bargain, and agreed expreſly for a <note place="margin">Verſ. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Penny a Day:</hi> They who came later, were content to ſtand to their Maſter's Courteſy, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the work upon this general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that <note place="margin">Verſ. 4. 7.</note> 
               <hi>whatſoever was right that they ſhould receive.</hi> And again, when the Toil and Duty was over, Theſe Laſt received their Pay with Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Decency; but the Former with Murmurings and ſawcy Expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; envying their Brethren's good Acceptance, and boldly arraigning their Lord's Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The ſame is to be ſaid of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to whom this Parable is generally ſuppoſed to refer; and many Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are obſervable in Them, which might move God to govern his Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions by the ſame Meaſures here too. The <hi>Jews</hi> were under the conſtant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his Laws, but then they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49873:49"/> were of a ſlaviſh and mercenary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; <note place="margin">Grot. in loc.</note> Driven by preſent Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and encouraged by Temporal Bleſſings. Proſperous Succeſſes of this Life were litterally indented for, and whatever they received, they look'd upon it as a Debt. Whereas the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> on the contrary, were under no ſuch former Covenant; Theſe, when called into the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at their Lord's feet, cloſed with the Goſpel upon his own Terms, ſtood entirely to His Goodneſs; went chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to work, and were content with the proſpect of diſtant and unſeen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: and whatever was given Them, they received it as the effect of Grace and great Beneficence. And this may very well be admitted for one good Conſideration, to recommend them to more favour.</p>
            <p>Again, We muſt remember, that the Value of any Service or Obedience riſes, in proportion to the Difficulties and Diſadvantages, which the Perſon breaks through to pay it. And this preſents us with another mighty Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity in the Caſe now under debate. The <hi>Jews</hi> had been breed up in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which had little elſe in it, but
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49873:49"/> Shadows and Figures of the Chriſtian diſpenſation. They had heard the Voice of the Prophets every day, and were well acquainted with the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Miracles, by which our <hi>Jeſus</hi> proved his Miſſion and Meſſiahſhip. The Moral Law was likewiſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent preparation for thoſe Doctrines of higher Perfection, which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel built upon it; And the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God, and his former Revelations, made the paſſage more eaſy for the Myſteries of the Chriſtian Faith. For perſons therefore thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to come in to the Preaching and the Church of Chriſt, was no more than might in reaſon be expected, and They, who did it not, were juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, as paſt all Excuſe. But it was no leſs ſurpriſing, on the other hand, that the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who knew very little of God before, and had run greedily into all manner of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity and Exceſs, ſhould on a ſudden make ſo brave a Stand. That They ſhould at once renounce all their pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Worſhip, and Licentious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and conform to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of a moſt Holy Religion; That They, who in former Ages were utter
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49873:50"/> Strangers to the true God, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Word of God Incarnate, at a time, <note place="margin">John I. 11.</note> when he <hi>came to his Own</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, <hi>and his Own received him not.</hi> But above all, This was a moſt ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing inſtance of their Sincerity and marvellous Zeal, that Men, who lived ſo much in the dark about the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul, and who abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denyed the Reſurrection of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſhould with ſuch Alacrity forego the Enjoyments of the preſent world, and ſtake down their very Lives, for a Crown to be obtain'd after Death; In a State, of which they had never known, ſcarce ever heard any thing at all before.</p>
            <p>The Condition of Late Penitents is thus far the ſame; that They too attain to a through Reformation, and a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life very hardly. For Habits of the Mind, and eſpecially Vicious ones, are not vanquiſh'd without much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and many ſharp Diſputes. The power of Cuſtom is exceeding great; but in Wicked practices the Difficulty is doubled, becauſe there Corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtrikes in, and Cuſtom is ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by Inclination. All the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances that a Man thus fallen can make,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49873:50"/> are ſo many Violences committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf. And the bringing the Byaſs of Senſual Appetite to draw true, working the Soul to a Diſreliſh of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Gains and Pleaſures, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ones ſelf a <hi>New Heart,</hi> and a <hi>New Spirit,</hi> are long and laborious Undertakings. Such they are indeed, as nothing but Experience can give us any juſt notion of; Unknown to thoſe happy men, who have always preſerved their good Principles, and never drunk of Vice, nor taſted its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicating Pleaſures. Theſe have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, but to proceed: to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their ground, and advance ſmoothly, as new opportunities of Improvement ſhall offer, and the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Delights of Holineſs quicken them up to it. And if the God of Mercy be gracious to this conſtant and ſedate Piety, where every thing is agreeable and inviting, ſhall he not extend his Bowels of Compaſſion, to Them alſo, who ſerve him in Tears, and Groans, in bitter Remorſe and earneſt Prayers? Will he deſpiſe the Terrours and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, the Sorrows and Reproaches of a ſelf-condemning Breaſt? No, no. He will behold ſuch Anguiſh with
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49873:51"/> Pity, and aſſiſt the Pangs and Strugg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of this Second Birth: It is an act becoming his Fatherly tenderneſs, his eſſential Goodneſs, and Wiſdom, and Juſtice, to make thoſe gallant Combatants Triumphant hereafter, whom nothing leſs than an undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Zeal, and a powerful Faith, long time, indefatigable pains, and invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Reſolution, could ever have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Victorious over Sin here. And upon the account, that ſuch a mighty Change argues a noble Diſpoſition; a Change, which none but Great and Generous Souls have the Courage to go through with; Upon this account, I ſay, probably it is, that our Bleſſed Saviour declares elſewhere, <note place="margin">Luke XV. 7. 10. Chryſoſ. Tom. 5. Serm. 52. Pag. 353. Ed. Eton.</note> 
               <hi>There is more Joy in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine Just Perſons, that need no Repentance,</hi> i. e. This Alteration is not only more ſenſible, but in ſome reſpects more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, more commendable, than an eaſy uninterrupted courſe of ſteady and always ſucceſsful Vertue; which never felt the dangers, nor lay under the Diſcouragements, of former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats, and an inſulting Conqueror to rally and make head againſt, with
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49873:51"/> forces often beat, and miſerably bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But, <hi>Secondly.</hi> The Parable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves another Difference between theſe <hi>Labourers, after the Work was over; That,</hi> They who were hired late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their pay with all due Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Thankfulneſs, but thoſe that came in early, with Repining and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. <note place="margin">Chryſ. in loc. T. 2. Serm. 64. Pag. 408.</note> 
               <hi>They murmured againſt the Good man of the Houſe</hi> (ſays the Verſe next after my Text) This Paſſage St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> will by no means allow us to underſtand ſtrictly and literally. It being a contradiction to all our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Heaven, that any grumbling or envious Diſpoſition ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thither: And therefore he looks upon it, as a Circumſtance of the Parable purely Ornamental, and ſet to ſignify ſo great a degree of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, as would naturally provoke our Envy in this World. And thus, no doubt, with regard to the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of another Life we are obliged to take it: But yet (as he obſerves withal) there is a great deal both of Energy and Truth, in this Expreſſion, ſo far as the Parable concerns the Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> For nothing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49873:52"/> is more remarkable, than the implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Malice and proud Spight of the <hi>Jews,</hi> upon this occaſion; Which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them to ſuch an Exceſs, as even to refuſe Salvation, and think it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath their acceptance, if they muſt have it in common with other deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Nations. This is manifeſtly the Fault our Saviour aimed at here; and it is that, which many perſons, of lives unblameable for the main, are, in all ages, guilty of. An over-valuing of their own Righteouſneſs, and a thinking Scorn, (with that <hi>Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in the Parable) that Returning <hi>Prodigals,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke XV. 28, 29, 30.</note> Wretches once profligate and infamous, ſhould have an equal place in their Heavenly Father's Love.</p>
            <p>But now the <hi>Gentiles</hi> formerly, and many reform'd Sinners ſince, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared themſelves particularly to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, by their deep Humility and Meekneſs of Spirit, by reſembling Him in a moſt extenſive Charity, a generous Largeneſs of Heart, which fills them with unfeigned Joy at the Recovery of their once loſt, and to all appearance deſperate, Brethren, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines them to delight in the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all mankind, and to eſteem
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49873:52"/> their own more exalted, when the Mercy of God is magnified, and the number of his Bleſſed Saints increaſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly.</hi> It is very probable there may be Another Difference, not leſs conſiderable than either of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and that is a <hi>Difference in the Work it ſelf.</hi> The Parable indeed is ſilent in this particular, perhaps for a Reaſon which I ſhall mention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: <note place="margin">See <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> here Note <hi>b.</hi>
               </note> But ſome <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Fables very like this, reply thus to the murmuring Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>This man hath the hire of a Day becauſe he hath in two hours done the work of a whole Day.</hi> Thus much however is certain in the Subject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended, for excelling in Zeal, and in the Graces of Chriſtianity, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things to their utmoſt, <note place="margin">2 Cor. VIII. 3. 1 Cor. I. 7.</note> nay even <hi>beyond their power,</hi> and fired by a generous Emulation to <hi>come behind</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> in no Vertue. Thus alſo upon Repentance from a very diſſolute Life, we often obſerve men act with double Vigour, and indefatigable Diligence; ſadly ſenſible of the Time they have loſt, and impatient to redeem it by the beſt improvement of that little they have left; deſirous to make Religion
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49873:53"/> ſome amends for the injury and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they have done it formerly, and to give the world ſatisfaction for the Scandal of an ill Example, by ſetting one as eminently good, and being for the future the very Reverſe of what they were before. And that this is the natural Conſequence of breaking off from a wicked courſe, is plain from our Saviour's diſcourſe upon waſhing his feet; <note place="margin">Luke VII. 44, &amp;c.</note> where he applies to the different behaviour of a Penitent Woman, and a proud Phariſee, that Parable of the two Debtors, which proves, that He who is moſt ſenſible of the Greatneſs of his Sins, and the Mercy of Forgiveneſs, will naturally love God moſt, and by all his actions give teſtimony that he does ſo.</p>
            <p>Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in his own Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, that, though he was the <hi>laſt,</hi> and <hi>leaſt of the Apoſtles,</hi> not <hi>worthy</hi> that name, <note place="margin">1 Cor. XV. 8, 9. 10.</note> becauſe as one <hi>born out of due time, and once a Perſecutor of the Church of God,</hi> yet <hi>he laboured more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly than they all.</hi> And in ſuch a caſe, a man's Obedience will be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, not by Length of Time, but by the Fervency of the Deſire, and the Sincerity of the Heart. A few exalted
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49873:53"/> acts of Conſtancy and Piety may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a man's affection as effectually as many years practice; and in the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Equity weigh againſt a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Others, where the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were not ſo trying. And God, who ſees the Heart, judges us, not only by what we do, but by what we are ready and reſolved to do, and would certainly accompliſh, if we had opportunity. Thus Innocence or ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Vertue may be crowned, not only for the little it hath done, but for the noble Fruits, which God foreſees that generous Plant would bear, had not he for wiſe reaſons cut it off, before it arrived to ripeneſs of Years and Judgment. Thus a Man, who is hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily diſpoſed to continue faithful in deſpight of all hardſhip and ſuffering, may be conſidered for that habitual Steadineſs of mind, no leſs than if God had brought the fiery Tryal upon him. <note place="margin">Luke XXIII. 42, 43.</note> And thus the Thief upon the Croſs, by one Glorious Confeſſion of Chriſt at his laſt hour, obtained remiſſion of his whole paſs'd wicked Life, and an entrance into Paradiſe that very day.</p>
            <pb n="90" facs="tcp:49873:54"/>
            <p>When I urge theſe Arguments, my meaning is only thus much. That This is oftentimes the Caſe, and that there is a great deal in the Reaſon and Nature of the thing, which ſhould puſh on the Labourers who come in late, to exert and diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the works of Righteouſneſs, and Charity, and a ſtrict exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Converſation. So that an equal Reward is not ſuppoſed by this Particular, except there be an equal Vertue. But then this Vertue may be either apparent in the outward Acts, or it may be inward in the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which to God, who is the Judge and Rewarder, is all one; for He ſees it, though Men do not. Where there is no ſuch equality in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the Parable does not aſſert any equality in the Wages; for the Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm illuſtrated is not <hi>All,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ch. XIX. 30.</note> but <hi>Many that are firſt ſhall be laſt,</hi> and <hi>the laſt, ſhall be firſt,</hi> Or (as another Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt hath expreſſed it) <note place="margin">Luk. XIII. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Behold there are Laſt which ſhall be Firſt, and there are Firſt which ſhall be Laſt.</hi> Some <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> (that is,) who have not the ſame advantages of Faith and a Good Life, will excel ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> who have grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49873:54"/> And Some late Penitents will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do others of an early Piety: The Arrogant Righteous ſhall be degraded for their Envy and Spiritual Pride; And the Contrite, the Humble, the Charitable Convert ſhall be exalted and preferr'd: The Vertues conſpicuous in one ſort of theſe men being thus caſt into Scales, againſt thoſe which the Other have not, or have them in a leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or ſully them with ſome Blemiſh or notable Imperfection.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the <hi>Firſt</hi> Reaſon ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from thoſe Differences, which the Parable it ſelf leads us to obſerve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the late and early Labourers. But it muſt be confeſs'd,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Main Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that wherein the Parable is moſt expreſs, why this Proceeding cannot poſſibly be any imputation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of Almighty God, is what we meet with here in anſwer to the grumbling Workmen, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this Repreſentation, <note place="margin">Verſ. 13, 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>Friend, I do thee no wrong. Didſt not thou agree with me for a Penny? Take that is thine, and go thy way. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own? Is thine Eye evil, becauſe I am
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49873:55"/> good?</hi> This Reply teaches us, <hi>that</hi> Eternal Life is at leaſt a valuable (it is indeed an infinite and moſt diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate) Conſideration, for the beſt and moſt laborious Services: <hi>that</hi> it is God's <hi>own to do what he will with,</hi> a free Gift even to Them who make good Their part. For it was his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy alone, which moved him to ſeek theſe Labourers; And admit them to ſo advantagious an Agreement. And we cannot be guilty of a vainer thought, nor caſt a greater Blemiſh upon our good works, than to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Heaven due to them, as a ſtrict and adequate Reward. To incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this notion of God's Bounty and free Grace the more, I take the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Servants Work to be omitted, who were ſent into the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard in the declining of the Day. And not only ſo, but This ſhews us moreover, that, when We our ſelves are ſatisfied, and have all we can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, it no way concerns Us how Other people are dealt with. Almighty God is Maſter of his own Favours, and when he does right and juſtice to All, though he ſhould to Some give Over-meaſure, yet this cannot be any
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49873:55"/> wrong to Them who have their Full meaſure. To find fault with our Lord's liberality in ſuch diſtributions argues inſufferable Inſolence and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and would not be, were we but thoroughly poſſeſt with that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt opinion of our own performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that Grateful Senſe of his Goodneſs, which is due to a God, of whoſe abundant and mere mercy it is, that even the Beſt men receive at leaſt as much, in truth inſinitely more than they ever did, or can deſerve.</p>
            <p>I beg your patience but one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment longer, while I deliver the Text from Two Erroneous Opinions, which unwary Readers may be apt to draw from it: And theſe are all the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences I ſhall raiſe from the foregoing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And <hi>Firſt,</hi> It cannot with any good reaſoning be concluded from hence, <note place="margin">Matth. IX. 13. XII. 7.</note> that <hi>the Rewards of all Good men in the next world are equal.</hi> The Scripture manifeſtly prefers Some good works before Others, and it affirms too, <note place="margin">Pſal. LXII. 12.</note> that <hi>God rewardeth every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his works.</hi> It declares, <note place="margin">2 Cor. V. 10. 2 Cor. IX. 6.</note> that <hi>He which ſoweth ſparingly ſhall reap ſparingly; and He which ſoweth bountifully, ſhall
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49873:56"/> reap bountifully.</hi> So then Both ſhall <hi>reap,</hi> becauſe both have <hi>ſown;</hi> but yet Each ſhall <hi>reap,</hi> in proportion to what Each hath <hi>ſown.</hi> By the <hi>Penny</hi> here is meant Eternal Life, and the Happineſs of all the Bleſſed ſhall be Eternal. The <hi>Jews,</hi> who receive and obey the Goſpel, ſhall go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſo ſhall the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The men of conſtant Holineſs ſhall go to Heaven, and ſo ſhall the ſincere Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents. The Martyrs ſhall be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo ſhall the Chriſtians, who live well, and die in Peace. This is the utmoſt, that the Analogy of the Parable directs us to, that theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of perſons ſhall be Happy; and that the Happineſs of them all ſhall never have an End. But, whether all their Crowns ſhall be equally bright, whether the Degrees of their Felicity ſhall be the ſame, is a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion foreign to our preſent purpoſe, and ſuch as the Text is no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in. Nay, we are aſſured, both from Reaſon and Scripture, that they ſhall not. For, though all the <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly.</hi> The Favour ſhewed here to Them who were hired at the <hi>Eleventh hour, is no encouragement for any man's delaying his Repentance, no not one Moment.</hi> For, What is this <hi>Eleventh hour?</hi> Strictly and properly it is no doubt God's laſt Call to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and that Call is made in the Goſpel; there being no other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to ſucceed in the place of this, No new Covenant, or more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Terms in reſerve, for Them who do not come in, and cloſe with theſe. And though we ſhould, (as we may conveniently enough) apply this to the Age of each particular Chriſtian; Yet even thus it gives no countenance to the frivolous excuſes of Slothful and Impenitent Sinners. For we do not read, that They who were <hi>hired</hi> then, had heard the Call ſooner. The Parable is ſilent, as to the Cauſes of their Abſence, and, though indeed it hints Idleneſs to have been at the bottom, yet it no where ſays, that there were Any preſent, at the <hi>Firſt,</hi> and <hi>Third,</hi> and <hi>Sixth,</hi> and <hi>Ninth</hi> hours, who, after perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49873:57"/> refuſing to come in then, were called again, and received at the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth.</hi> So that This does by no means come up to the Caſe of thoſe obſtinate and refrectory, thoſe unperſwadeable and incorrigible Wretches, in whoſe Ears the Inſtructions and holy Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of God are continually ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and yet they harden themſelves, and make it a point of wicked Bravery to turn the deaf Ear, and hold out againſt them. What reaſon can we aſſign then, why God ſhould not give ſuch people over to their own fooliſh perverſe choice, by withdrawing his Grace, and leaving off thoſe ſo long fruitleſs attempts to do them good?</p>
            <p>But farther yet, ſuppoſing God not to be ſo far provoked, as to ſuffer his wrath to take place in this reſpect; yet, conſidering the Condition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and the Uncertainty of Life, why ſhould we not look upon Every hour as our <hi>Eleventh</hi> hour? Each invitation to our happineſs, may be the laſt that ever will be made us. Each Sermon, the laſt we may ever hear: Each Sacrament, the laſt we may ever be allowed to partake of. We can have no abſolute Aſſurance that it ſhall not
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49873:57"/> be ſo; and it would be our wiſdom to behave our ſelves, as though we were aſſured it ſhall be ſo. But I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear purſuing this Argument here, and refer my Reader for more full conviction to the next diſcourſe. In the mean while it would well become every one of us, frequently and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to apply to his own Caſe, what our Bleſſed Lord once ſaid of himſelf, <note place="margin">Joh.

            <p>MY Text is part of a Paſſage, very Remarkable, very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, very Inſtructive. But ſuch a one withal, as deſerves to be very carefully conſidered, becauſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49873:58"/> otherwiſe it may be abuſed to the worſt of purpoſes, and have that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, which it adminiſters to Grievous, provided they be ſincerely Penitent, Offenders, perverted into an occaſion of dangerous Security to the Habitual and Negligent Sinners. I ſhall therefore make it my buſineſs ſo to treat of this Thief upon the Croſs, received into Grace at his laſt hour, as to encourage all wicked men to Repentance; yet without flattering ſuch in a falſe and unreaſonable hope of finding God as eaſy to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Them, who wilfully drive off the making their Peace with him till their laſt hour.</p>
            <p>It might indeed be reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that ſeveral other very weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and profitable points might have ſome place in a Diſcourſe upon this Subject. But That which I have more eſpecially in view, and the only one I ſhall inſiſt upon at preſent, is This. <hi>That</hi> This Example, when rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and equally weighed in all its Circumſtances, is no reaſonable ground for any man's deferring his Reformation one ſingle hour; much leſs than for depending upon a Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49873:59"/> Repentance, to procure him Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Salvation.</p>
            <p>There are ſundry Arguments fetch'd from Reaſon and Scripture, which, if men would have the Patience to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſeriouſly and impartially, could not, one would think, but prevail with them, to ſet about a Work, which even They, that excuſe themſelves from doing it in good earneſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be abſolutely neceſſary. But when they are preſſed to begin it ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, when We, whoſe Office and Duty oblige us, to call upon, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently importune them to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Undertaking, warn them how dangerous Delays are; how fatal in this, above any other Matter; They preſently take Shelter in the Inſtance of my Text, and are willing to think that Their Faults are leſs than thoſe of this Thief, and therefore they can ſee no reaſon, why their Repentance, though it come as late, ſhould not be altogether as ſucceſsful. Now in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting this darling Impoſture, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtay to urge a ſpeedy Repentance, from all the Topicks proper for that purpoſe; but muſt confine my ſelf within the Compaſs of this ſo much
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49873:59"/> abuſed Example. And I ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with hoping, that when once the Sinner is beaten from this hold, the other Arguments uſually produced to this purpoſe, will find him open to their force, and be able to make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of him.</p>
            <p>And here, that we may bring the Matter to as quick and as fair an Iſſue as is poſſible, I am content for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (to give up ſome things, which yet perhaps, were I diſpoſed to be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious, would not ſo eaſily be wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from me; and) to allow the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions for a Late and Death-bed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, all the Advantages, which the Caſe before us can in any tolerable Conſtruction furniſh them with; As, for the purpoſe in theſe following Inſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whereas ſome have thought it probable, that this Thief might have been guilty in One Fact only, which though the Laws of men take hold of, is yet in the Eye of God leſs offenſive, than long and wilful habits of Sins leſs ſcandalous in their own Nature; and that he might poſſibly have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented long before, of this Fact too, for which he was now put to Death;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49873:60"/> I ſhall make no difficulty both to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he was an old, habitual Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in other Inſtances, and to allow that his Converſion and Repentance were of no older date, than this publick Declaration of them mentioned by St. <hi>Luke.</hi> Nay, if you pleaſe, I will accept St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s and St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Method of reconciling This with the other Evangeliſts; Which is, that this Thief alſo did at firſt joyn with his Fellow in reproaching and railing at Jeſus; but that afterwards by our Lord's behaviour, and the many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Appearances at his Paſſion, he was powerfully wrought upon, and preſently changed as we ſee. And conſequently his Acceptance with Chriſt muſt have proceeded from this ſudden, this late, Conviction and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. A Repentance begun, as well as finiſhed, in the very Act of Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some have alſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented this as an extraordinary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Caſe, not to be drawn into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample by Others: As Acts of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and Oblivion upon ſpecial E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergencies are no warrant for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects always to expect the like Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49873:60"/> or Favour from their Prince. But I am willing to wave this Plea too. I will not put the Grace extended to this dying Malefactor upon God's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Prerogative of Mercy, ſuperſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſtanding Meaſures of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as oft as he ſees fit; but ſhall admit it for a common Standard and Univerſal Rule. So that All, who are under the ſame Circumſtances with this Penitent Thief; may, by Virtue of the Goſpel Covenant, promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ſame kind reception and full pardon for all the Sins though never ſo many, never ſo grievous, of their whole paſt profligate Life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whereas ſome have ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly contended, that Repentance is a Change of Heart and Life both; and that, whatever it may appear, or be charitably hoped and ſuppoſed, yet in reality That is no Repentance, which does not prove its own Sincerity by a man's After-acts; I will ſatisfy my ſelf in the preſent Argument, with that looſer notion of the Word, which implies a Change of the Heart only. Conſequently I muſt grant, that what is commonly (though ſome pretend very improperly) called a Death-bed
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49873:61"/> Repentance, may be a true Repentance; Becauſe, though a new Courſe of Life would be abſolutely neceſſary (did the perſon ſurvive) to teſtify the truth of it to Men, yet God, who knows the Heart, needs no ſuch Teſtimony. And, upon this Suppoſition, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Eſſence of Repentance will conſiſt in a Renewing of the Mind and Affections; and the Actions will not be ſo much a part of the thing it ſelf, as an Evidence and Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing. Where Death then cuts off all Opportunities of giving ſuch proofs, we cannot upon theſe terms, conclude a man hath not repented, from his not being able to give Us this Proof of his Repentance.</p>
            <p>I would not be miſtaken in this matter. I do not aſſert theſe things to be juſt as I have laid them, I do not take upon me to determine one way or other; But, I ſay, I am content for the preſent, to have them thought ſo; as deſiring to put the faireſt and moſt favourable State of the Caſe. And I do not ſee how any Sinner, who will condeſcend to reaſon at all upon this Example, can pretend to carry it far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in favour of a Death-bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49873:61"/> than I have now done. And yet after coming down thus to the Sinners own Terms, I hope, by God's aſſiſtance, to convince him, that even This Example, thus interpreted, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far from bearing any man out in deferring his Repentance to his laſt, nay to the very next day.</p>
            <p>Now Every one knows, that, in arguing from Precedents the ſtrength of what we urge depends altogether upon the Reſemblance of the Caſe we argue for, to that Other which we argue from. So far as Theſe two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the Reaſoning is good; but where they differ, there can be no Conſequence. And if there be any diſagreement between them, though but in One material Circumſtance, the Former caſe cannot be admitted for a ſufficient Rule or Warrant to the Latter. Since therefore the Argument I am now upon is entirely Precedent and Example, and all I deſign is to overthrow the falſe Supports, which men, loath to break with their Sins till they can keep them no longer, have formed to themſelves from this Inſtance of the Thief upon the Croſs; they ought certainly to give up all
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49873:62"/> thoſe Encouragements for treacherous and unreaſonable, if I can ſhew theſe Three things;
<list>
                  <item>I. Firſt, <hi>That there were ſome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in Caſe of this Thief, to which that of no other man can ever be parallel.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. Secondly, <hi>That, admitting we ſhould come up to his Repentance, ſo far as it is imitable by us, yet none of us all can have the ſame Aſſurance of being pardoned and accepted. But, which is worſt of all,</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. Thirdly, <hi>That it is equally Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, nay indeed much more Probable, that, when we come to die,</hi> His <hi>Caſe may not be</hi> Ours, <hi>no not even in the very Diſpoſition to repent.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It deſerves to be very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively conſidered, <hi>That there are ſome Circumstances in the Caſe of this Penitent Thief, to which the Condition of no other man</hi> (but eſpecially of no Chriſtian, who deferrs his Repentance to a ſick or dying Bed) <hi>can poſſibly be parallel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in examining any of the ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and unuſual Acts of the Divine
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49873:62"/> Mercy, we muſt be ſure always to bring this Rule along with us, <hi>That</hi> Almighty God in the inſtances of his Love and Compaſſion is perfectly void of all that byaſs of Humour, and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Partial Fondneſs, which oftentimes are a Blemiſh to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of eaſy and good-natur'd Men; that He conſtantly acts with ſuch ſteadineſs, as becomes Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, regulated and duly tempered with Infinite Wiſdom and Infinite Juſtice. And conſequently, that all his Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are ſtrictly agreeable to Equity and Reaſon; Even thoſe of them, which we are not able to enter ſo far into the Grounds of, as to account for them in every particular, to Our ſelves, or to Others.</p>
            <p>Nor can it ſeem ſtrange, that we ſhould not be able to account for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matters of this Nature, when we reflect, that the moſt equitable rule of proceeding, both with God and Man, is to regard the Intentions and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the Perſons concerned. Now theſe are things that lye too deep for any but the Searcher of Hearts, to have a diſtinct ſight and entire knowledge of. And therefore
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49873:63"/> we ought always to conclude, that He, to whoſe view theſe things lie open, hath ſufficient motives which induce him to make a difference in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Some above Others. And ſuch difference, ſo far as we can judge, is made; as oft as They who in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance have done leſs, are made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to thoſe who in all appearance have done more. For, though God in the riches of his mercy may give Every good man a greater reward than is due to his work, yet his Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that Each of theſe good men be conſidered in proportion to his work. And though the beſt of us all cannot in rigour deſerve Remiſſion of Sins, and Acceptance of our Labours; yet we may have ſuch Qualifications, as will not fail to diſpoſe him to paſs by our Faults, and to receive us gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly.</p>
            <p>Again, The Worth and Efficacy of ſuch Qualifications is not always to be meaſured by the Length of Time, or by the number of Acts produced by them. Becauſe it may happen, that a very Few, or but One ſingle Inſtance may be ſo circumſtantiated, as to give teſtimony of a man's Sincerity and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49873:63"/> Zeal, equivalent to a Multitude of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And this is what I need not labour either to prove, or to apply, in the preſent Queſtion. For all men muſt allow, that He, who, in Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Repentance and Faith at his laſt hour, is received preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Paradiſe, does, like <hi>the Labourers of the Eleventh hour,</hi> attain an equal reward with Them, who by a long, painful and conſtant Obedience, have born the burden and heat of the Day; And They who interpret that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in favour of ſuch a Repentance, alledge, that God accepts the dying Penitent for his Integrity and Zeal; that he looks upon what the man would have done, as if it had been actually done; and judges him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Deſires and good Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions he had, and not according to the Opportunities he had not.</p>
            <p>From theſe things thus premiſed, it plainly appears, that, in order to a right underſtanding, and fair Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Example now before us, it will be neceſſary to enquire very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently into thoſe good Diſpoſitions of the Thief upon the Croſs, which might reaſonably be ſuppoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49873:64"/> him to Mercy, at his Death, notwithſtanding the grievous Offences of his paſt wicked Life. And, to any perſon who ſhall ſet himſelf ſeriouſly to conſider this matter, this Relation of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and the Caſe, as now ſtated, will ſufficiently intimate theſe Two eſpecially.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Great Ingenuity of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Readineſs of Mind to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Faith of Chriſt, ſo ſoon as ſufficient means of Conviction were afforded him. 'Tis highly probable, this man had never known any thing of <hi>Jeſus</hi> before, otherwiſe than by common fame; And, if St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s and St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s conjectures be juſt, he was prepoſſeſſed againſt him, as an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtour: If ſo, the greater ſtill was his Vertue, to overcome thoſe Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices ſo ſoon, and ſuffer the Meekneſs, and Patience, the Charity and Piety of our Lord's miraculous Death to diſabuſe him. This is ſo far from making him a late Penitent, that it gives him the Glory of an early Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert: One, whoſe heart was open to the firſt Impreſſions of Grace, and wanted, not ſo much the Inclination, as the Opportunity, of being brought
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49873:64"/> over to the Truth before. And, which is yet more for his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We may diſcern in him a moſt vigorous and noble Faith. <note n="*" place="margin">Chryſoſt. Tom. 5. Orat. 7. Pag. 26. Edit. Eton.</note> Such as confeſs'd our Lord in his loweſt, moſt afflicted, and moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Condition. When his hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Companion reviled him, When the Enemies of Jeſus mocked and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted over him, When his own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had forſaken, and were afraid to own him; Such as took ſanctuary in a dying and univerſally deſpiſed Man; Such as publiſhed his Innocence to the face, and in deſpight, of trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Malice; and, through the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cloud of Shame and Sufferings, that ever intercepted the Glories of the Son of God, diſcovered his Divine Power; and placed his hope in a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Kingdom, which Fleſh and Blood and Humane Reaſoning could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have diſcovered. A Kingdom which no Eye but that of Faith could have the leaſt glimpſe of; which even They who had enjoyed the honour and advantage of a Three-Year's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and inſeparable Converſation, never yet perfectly underſtood, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49873:65"/> now utterly deſpaired of. This was to come in <hi>no whit behind,</hi> nay it was in ſome reſpects to out-ſtrip the very <hi>Chiefeſt Apoſtles.</hi> This was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, ſo reſolute, ſo ſingular, ſo illuſtrious, that no Preacher, no Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, ever came up to all the height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning commendations of it. None gave ſo ample a Teſtimony to the Bleſſed Jeſus, becauſe None had this peculiar Excellence, of giving it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo many diſadvantagious and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>And now with what <note n="*" place="margin">Chryſoſt. Tom. 5. Orat. 7.</note> Forehead, with what Colour can any Late or Death-bed Penitent pretend to draw this Example into a Precedent for his own Support and Advantage? What Affinity, what Shadow of Reſemblance is there, between a man ſubmitting to the firſt Impreſſion, and One, who hath wilfully and induſtriouſly hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his heart againſt all the Methods of Inſtruction and amendment? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Man accepting offers as ſoon as they were made; and One who who hath refuſed and thruſt away Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from him; and ſtopped his Ears againſt the moſt affectionate and vehement Importunities? Between a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49873:65"/> Man following readily from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was called; and One, who hath run headily on a long and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate courſe of Wickedneſs, ridiculed Religion, caſt God's Word behind him, quenched and grieved his Spirit, and eſteemed it an inſtance of Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and Wit, and better Senſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue proof againſt all its motions and moſt ſollicitous ſtrivings with him for his Souls Good? Shall we be ſo unequal Judges in our own Caſe, ſo exceedingly blind and corrupt Advocates for Sin, to bring this unexpected Honour paid to our Saviour in his loweſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted State, to the wretched Level of thoſe Men, who, notwithſtanding his Reſurrection from the Dead, and Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in Glory; Notwithſtanding the Example of the Beſt and Wiſeſt Men; Notwithſtanding the Conqueſts made by his Goſpel, and the Infamy of denying him, yet injure, and affront, deſpiſe and defy him, and will not be prevailed upon to confeſs and come into him, till they cannot hold out in diſhonouring him any longer? The Thief acknowledged this King upon the Croſs, and theſe Men diſown him upon his Throne; His condition, ſeemingly forſaken both of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49873:66"/> God and Man, did not diſcourage That Penitent; But Theſe wicked Creatures will not be either awed or invited to come into his moſt proſperous and triumphant State, when all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to encourage their Obedience: And ſhall we make the One of theſe caſes a Pattern for the Other? Is it poſſible, that even Luſt and Partiality it ſelf ſhould draw any ſo perverſe, ſo abſurd Conſequences, as, from the Acceptance of ſo ready accompliance, and the Reward of ſo eminent, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd a Faith, to argue for the ſame Priviledges to long Preſumptuous Sin, inflexible Obſtinacy, and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Contempt? This is ſo far from <hi>Judging righteous Judgment,</hi> that it is not ſo much as <hi>judging according to the Appearance,</hi> For the Caſes, as to what concerns the merits of the Cauſe, are not alike in any one Point. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble one another in nothing, but that both the Perſons are dying. No Chriſtian, who hath lived under the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, can, at the end of his Days, plead the ſame ready compliance to the Calls of Grace; And no Man whatſoever can have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for exerting the ſame noble
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49873:66"/> Faith, becauſe Chriſt could die but once, and his Sufferings and Shame only could have render'd the Penitent Thief's Confeſſion ſo ſingularly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. This, I think, puts the <hi>Firſt</hi> Branch of my Argument beyond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; <hi>That</hi> no late or dying Penitent can ſafely depend upon this Example, as a Precedent for the ſucceſs of his own late Repentance; Becauſe there are in This caſe ſome Circumſtances, to which that of no Chriſtian, no not of any other Man in the World, ever were, or can be, parallel. I proceed now in the</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Second</hi> place to ſhew, <hi>That, even in thoſe parts of this Thief's Repentance, which are imitable by us, we cannot have the ſame Aſſurance of being pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and accepted.</hi> We may poſſibly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to his Contrition, and Godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; to his Humility, and ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſaving Faith, as our Condition will admit. But, allowing this to be poſſible, will it from thence follow, that we can be equally ſure that we have actually attained to them? The ſincerity of His Repentance is paſt a doubt, becauſe He, who knows what is in the Heart of every Man, approved and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49873:67"/> rewarded it. But we can only go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Preſumptions. The Comforts of our Friends, The Judgment of our Spiritual Guides, who would fain think the beſt, whom a falſe Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of our State may miſlead in their Opinion, or Charity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion may diſpoſe to paſs a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Sentence than we deſerve; More than theſe we cannot have, except the Teſtimonies of our own Breaſts; and our own Breaſts too often flatter us (God knows) into a fatal Security, and <hi>ſpeak Peace, when there is no Peace.</hi> For the <hi>Heart of Man is exceeding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, and deſperately wicked; Who can know it?</hi> And Who, the more he knows it, does not find ſtill more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect it? Thoſe, who argue for a late Repentance, place all the Efficacy of it in a Suppoſition; that the Perſon, if he had time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, would ſtedfaſtly perſevere in and faithfully make good, all his holy Purpoſes: But alas! how frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have we of the Contrary? and Who ſhall dare to preſume That to be his own Caſe, in which, if himſelf have not formerly failed, yet a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of pretending Penitents fail daily?
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49873:67"/> How many have we ſeen, who, if God had pleaſed to take them away while they ſeem'd to be in a good mind, had left behind them ſuch hopes of their happy Condition, that it would be thought uncharitable and unchriſtian to queſtion it; and yet all this was not the Man's Heart, but his Fright; a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon his Nature and ſettled Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; The Fit of Sickneſs, and that of Zeal, abated and wore off toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and aſſoon as the ſmart of the Rod was over, all the Remembrance and good Effect of it hath been over with them too. Thus many horrible Relapſes have taught us to be cautious, how we give too eaſie credit to ſuch falſe Appearances of Amendment any more; ſince neither did We underſtand theſe Men, nor They truly underſtand themſelves. Few Stomachs are ſo high and ſturdy, but the Approach of Death, the Terrours of an incenſed God, and the near proſpect of a Gaping Hell, will bring them down. When Men are juſt upon the brink of Eternity, a new Scene opens upon them; Theſe things will then be ſeen and heard; they intrude upon Mens thoughts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no; and make quite
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49873:68"/> different Impreſſions, from what they did while at a diſtance, when Health and Strength, the Hurry of Buſineſs, and variety of Pleaſures, helped to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and drive away the uneaſy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. And, when Matters are come to this Extremity, Who is ſo nice, as truly to diſtinguiſh between the Hatred of Sin and the Dread of Puniſhment; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Love of God and the Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care to preſerve our ſelves; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſorrow of the Penitent, and the amazement of his Fears, or the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy of his Diſeaſe? Theſe are ſo perplexed and intricate, that not only Others, but our Selves are exceeding apt to be confounded, and err, in our determinations concerning them. And yet Theſe are all that we have to go upon in a Death-bed Repentance. Which at laſt amount to no more than this; that it does not become Us to ſet bounds to the Mercies of God, and therefore to Him we muſt leave them; for He knows them and We do not; and therefore, how well ſoever we may hope, yet we cannot pronounce any thing peremptorily concerning them.</p>
            <p>Cold Comfort, God knows, and ſuch as no Man in his right Wits would
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49873:68"/> take up with, in his Greateſt, his On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Concern. Would Any of us be ſo ſtupid in the Affairs of this World, to content himſelf with a bare Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in Matters of the laſt Importance, when he might have an abſolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty? Would We forego our Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and abandon our ſelves to all the miſeries of Want, by ſetting our whole Eſtate upon the hazard of an After-Game, nay of an Equal Chance, when we have it in our Choice to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it againſt all the Power and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Fortune? Yet thus and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely worſe does every one, that hears me this day, play the fool, who ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures his Soul and Eternity upon a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or dying Repentance, the ſucceſs of which can never be proved to him, while yet he may effectually and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly inſure both by a ſpeedy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Repentance, which by producing worthy fruits will demonſtrate its own ſincerity, and prove its ſelf. But why do I talk of an Even Chance, when the Odds are manifeſtly againſt us; for my laſt, and moſt mortifying Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all, is</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>it is not only equally Poſſible, but highly Probable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49873:69"/> that when we come to dye, We may not be like this Thief upon the Croſs, no not ſo much as in the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and very Deſire to repent.</hi> The Paſſage, of which my Text is a Part, gives us likewiſe an Example of a Wicked Man, dying hard and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent; and if This had not the ſame fate of being overlookt, which all things have that make againſt thoſe corrupt Inclinations we delight to cheriſh, why ſhould not That be as ſtrong an Argument to warn us of our Danger, as the Other is pretended to be for the flattering our Security? Are not His contradicting and blaſpheming Chriſt, as manifeſt inſtances of God's forſaking Men at their laſt hour, as this Man's acknowledging and praying to him can poſſibly be of their being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and accepted at their laſt hour? The Examples of each kind make the matter equal, but the Reaſon of the thing is far from leaving it ſo; This miniſters infinitely more ground of Fear than of Hope. For Repentance, as well as other Virtues, is the Effect of God's Grace; And, though Grace in the nature of the thing imply a Freedom of Diſtribution, yet, God
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49873:69"/> hath thought fit to ſuſpend this Gift upon certain Conditions, and told us upon what Terms only we may, and upon what we have no right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it. That it ſhall be increaſed to them who uſe it diligently, but taken away from ſuch as neglect and abuſe the precious Talent, committed to their Improvement. And, if theſe be the Meaſures God hath fixed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, how can Thoſe Men promiſe themſelves any Safety, who have all along rejected the only Inſtrument of their Recovery? who have defied the Laws, and defeated all the Methods of God; reſiſted his repeated importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, dared his vengeance, and now at laſt do not ſo properly leave their Sins, as they are left of them; Who begin to live well, when they think they can live no longer; and were not content to be turned over to God's Service, till Impotence, or Age, or Sickneſs, had rendred them incapable of doing the Devil's Drudgery? St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath read ſuch People's deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, by telling them (<hi>Rom.</hi> II. 4. 5.) that <hi>they who deſpiſe the riches of his mercy, and forbearance, and long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and do not conſider, that the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49873:70"/> of God leads to Repentance, treaſure up to themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi> So little Encouragement is there to think, that God will enable us to do that, when we come to dye, which we never would be perſwaded to do, while we lived. So juſt occaſion to apprehend, that the Railing and Obdurate Thief's Lot will be Ours. Since Obſtinacy is what God hath provided no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt; And They, who ſo perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly chuſe damnation, make too bold with God, when they look for miraculous and extraordinary Methods, to prevent their inheriting the portion of their Perverſe Folly, and being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the bitter fruit of their own Devices.</p>
            <p>By this time, I hope, you ſee how weakly They are entrenched, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify themſelves in a ſinful Courſe with the ſucceſs of this Thief upon the Croſs. And that, the whole Matter duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, they are utterly diſarmed of their falſe confidences, and all their own Artillery is turned upon them. For this Paſſage does give us indeed a plain Example of a Man, who was given up to a reprobate Mind, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49873:70"/> of Grace at his laſt hour. But neither This, nor any Other paſſage of Scripture that I know of, furniſhes One ſingle inſtance which comes up to the Caſe of common Chriſtians, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us a Man rejecting and living impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent under, the means of Grace, and then converted and ſaved at his laſt hour.</p>
            <p>But what then is the proper Uſe to be made of this Paſſage, and where are the ſweet, the ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled Conſolations attributed to it? Even Theſe; that it ſupports Men with an Inſtance, of a great and grievous Malefactor received into Grace, juſt at his leaving the World; Thus it teaches us, that no Impurities of Life, though never ſo foul, No Crimes though never ſo black, never ſo numerous, ſhut us out from Mercy, provided we ſincerely repent; that the Grace of God can pluck back Wretches, when they are at the laſt gaſp, and juſt dropping into everlaſting Torments; but, as to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Repentance it ſelf, and ſuch Grace being extended to thoſe when they come to death's door, who have been headſtrong and habitual Sinners all their days; the moſt that can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from hence, is, that ſuch a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49873:71"/> thing <hi>may</hi> be; but it gives us no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Security, nor ſo much as one probable Argument to conclude, that it certainly <hi>ſhall</hi> be. In a Word, Repentance, when true, is never too late, and therefore the Thief upon the Croſs is a Sovereign Antidote againſt Deſpair: But Men may outſtay the day of Grace; they may not go about this Work till it be ſo late, that they have loſt both the Will and the Power to repent; and therefore this Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when truly conſidered, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Preſervative againſt Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too.</p>
            <p>After this, would the Time and Your Patience admit me, I might hope to make ſome good Impreſſion, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to You, The Unfitneſs of a Sick Bed or infirm Years for ſo long and laborious a Work as true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is; The danger of delaying it, from the Uncertainty of Life; And the vain Sophiſtry of all thoſe trifling pretences, whereby Men delude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this important Affair. But I forbear, and only beg You to act in this, with the ſame prudence you would in matters of leſs moment. You
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49873:71"/> would not, if you knew a Medicine, which hath recovered thouſands, and will infallibly cure, if applied in the beginning of the diſtemper, you would not in a mortal diſeaſe defer ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication till a Caſe of extremity, when never any that you know of was reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by it but One, and His Symptoms too vaſtly different from Yours. You would not venture your whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance upon ſo mad a hazard, where there have been Millions of Blanks for One Prize; and that Prize too got by ſuch a Chance, as can never come up again. Why will you then, with your Eyes open, run ſuch a deſperate riſque of Eternity; <hi>Eternity,</hi> to which the longeſt Life bears not the proportion of a ſingle moment? Why will you ſtake your Souls upon ſo certain a Loſs; <hi>Your Souls,</hi> for which the whole World (could you gain it) is not an equivalent? If therefore you have any regard to theſe; As you would eſcape the agonies of Guilt, the horrours of Deſpair, and dreadful looking for of fiery Indignation to conſume You; as You would ſecure peace of Conſcience, the favour of God, and thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49873:72"/> proſpects of bliſs, which alone can ſupport your drooping Spirits when all worldly comforts forſake You; if there be any charms in the Hope of Heaven here, and the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of hereafter; Let my Advice be acceptable to You;</p>

            <p>AMong the many helps and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to a Godly Life, which the Holy Scriptures fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuh us with; None are more uſeful, none better qualified for ſucceſs, than Thoſe, which a prudent and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Reader may draw, from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of eminent Saints recorded there. And Theſe may be of Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Benefit to us; Not only by thoſe ſhining Graces and Virtues, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Piety, and unſhaken Perſeverance,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49873:73"/> which ought to provoke our Zeal and encourage our Imitation: But no leſs by thoſe Blemiſhes and Failings, that Proneneſs to Sin even in the Beſt men, and the Diligence and Painfulneſs of that Repentance, by which they were reſtored to the Favour of God. Which ſhould abate our vain Confidences, and awaken our Care. Of this latter ſort is the Inſtance now before us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning St. <hi>Peter,</hi> whoſe Denial of our Saviour all the four Evangeliſts have given us a large and particular account of; and Three of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his bitter remorſe of it. St. <hi>Mark</hi> in the Words of my Text, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined me indeed to this Laſt only; But becauſe we ſhall be better able to make a right Judgment of his Repentance, when we have firſt conſidered the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Crime that occaſioned it; And in regard the One as well as the Other, may miniſter abundant Matter of Profit and Inſtruction; I ſhall, in treating of this Subject, take in the whole Compaſs of it, and diſcourſe, as well of the Fault implied and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerred to, as of the Repentance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly contained, in my Text.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:49873:74"/>
            <p>And here I cannot think it neceſſary to employ my own Pains or your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, in any Critical Niceties, which may tend to reconcile thoſe ſeeming Differences between the ſeveral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels, in ſome Circumſtances relating to this Affair; Which yet, to perſons not very captious and perverſe, are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a fair and eaſy Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But there is matter of far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moment, which calls for our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. And the Subſtance, wherein they agree beyond all Controverſy, is, that both St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fault, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, were very Great and Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary. He denied Chriſt, He did it to avoid being thought one of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by the Servants of the High-Prieſt, He perſiſted in that Denial, He repeated and ſtrengthened it with the Solemnity of Oaths and Curſes: But when the Crowing of the Cock, and the Look of his Maſter had call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the Powers of Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection in his mind; Immediately, upon reflecting what he had done, he went out and wept; He wept <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt</hi> then. Let us conſider St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Fault, and thoſe Circumſtances at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it,</hi> which may give us a true State of his Caſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And here, <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, it was undoubtedly one great Aggravation of this Fault, to have been committed by St. <hi>Peter.</hi> A Perſon, who had enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Benefit of a long and familiar Converſation with his Maſter; Who had not only heard the many excellent Inſtructions delivered to the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, which upon all occaſions flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in great Numbers, to be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49873:75"/> taught by him; but who, in private Conferences, had been let in to a more full and diſtinct Underſtanding of thoſe Myſteries, which for wiſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had been expreſt to the promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Crowd of Hearers in Terms ſometimes ambiguous and dark. A Perſon, who, beſides the infinite Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought publickly in Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Truth, had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be an Eye-Witneſs of ſuch as more clearly and immediately gave Teſtimony to his Lord's Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Authority. Such in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular as the Appearance of <hi>Moſes</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. XVII.</note> and <hi>Elias,</hi> at our Lord's Transfiguration; that <hi>Honour</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">2 Pet. I. 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>and Glory which Jeſus received from God the Father, when there came ſuch a voice to him from the excellent Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed. Which voice from heaven,</hi> himſelf declares, <hi>he heard, when he was with him in the holy mount.</hi> A Perſon, whom out Lord had choſen the Companion <note n="‖" place="margin">Verſ. 33.</note> of his Agonies and Sufferings; and whoſe Negligence <note n="*" place="margin">Verſ. 37.</note> and Security in time of Danger and Temptation, had been ſo kindly and ſo lately reproved. A Perſon ſo advanced in Knowledge,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49873:75"/> as to make that early Confeſſion of his being <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. XVI. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>the Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> for which he received a particular Bleſſing and Commendation. A Perſon, who had been fore-warned of the extreme Peril of denying this Maſter, and told in very ſolemn manner <note n="†" place="margin">Mark VIII. 38.</note> that <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould be aſhamed of Him and his words in that adulterous and ſinful Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> and for ſuch Shame ſhould decline <hi>the confeſſing him before men; of Him alſo ſhould the Son of Man be aſhamed, when he cometh in Glory with his Angels, and deny him at the laſt day before his Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> A Perſon, who in a due Senſe of all this, had that very Evening profeſſed himſelf ready to go with him <hi>both</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Luke XXII. 33.</note>

               <hi>offended</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Maſter's Sufferings, <hi>yet would not he;</hi> And therefore being, as he thought, abundantly reſolved, and ſecure of himſelf in this Point, <note n="†" place="margin">Verſ. 31.</note> 
               <hi>ſpake
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49873:76"/> the more vehemently, If I ſhould die with thee, yet will I not deny thee in any wiſe.</hi> Laſtly, A Perſon who, according to his natural warmth of Temper, had not only committed himſelf to the Mercy of the Winds and Waves at Jeſus Command, and received a moſt ſenſible and convincing Experiment of his Lord's Almighty Power, by being preſerved from ſinking; but, even in the midſt of his Affliction, had juſt before given a raſh and dangerous Proof of his Zeal, by drawing in his defence, and wounding one of the Officers, that came to apprehend him. And yet, Notwithſtanding all this Knowledge and former Conviction, Notwithſtanding ſuch warning, and long experience, Notwithſtanding all his boaſted firmneſs of mind, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward attempts to reſcue ſo dear a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; This very St. <hi>Peter</hi> fell off in time of Tryal, and denied and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed all relation to, all knowledge of, that very <hi>Jeſus.</hi> In all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects then, the fault muſt needs be more heinous in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> than it would have been in any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Man; becauſe it is a known and obvious Rule of Juſtice, that a Man's
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49873:76"/> Guilt in any caſe is to be meaſured in proportion to his advantages of doing better, the Reſolutions that he will, and the Senſe of his own Breaſt, that he ought to, behave himſelf otherwiſe. The greater Reaſon have we to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> What might be the Cauſe of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Miſcarriage in the Inſtance now before us. Now this, it is very plain, was his Fear: And Fear is a Paſſion ſo interwoven with Humane Nature; ſo immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent upon that Principle of Self-Preſervation, which ſeems to be the firſt and loudeſ. Dictate of Reaſon; ſo apt to confound and overbear our Judgment, where it hath got Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soul; that no Infirmity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails more ſtrongly, or, when extreme and juſt, is more excuſed. Religion as well as Philoſophy will, I think, admit <hi>Tully</hi>'s diſtinction of <hi>Metus qui cadere poteſt in conſtantem virum:</hi> Some Apprehenſions of Danger, from which the beſt and braveſt minds are not exempted. And, where ſuch Tryals fall upon men, as ſcarce any preſence or firmneſs of Soul ſeems to be a match for, as we do not blame
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49873:77"/> but pity the unhappy Effects of Them who ſtand not the Shock; ſo God, no doubt, who made us, and knows what we are able to bear, will not fail to compaſſionate, and make Gracious allowances for, ſuch Failings. Had this been St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Caſe, it had been a mighty abatement to his fault. Had the Extremity, by which he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to it, been ſome ſudden ſtartling Accident, of which he had received no warning, could not have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any reaſonable expectation, and conſequently could not be ſuppoſed to make proviſion againſt; much more might be alledged in his excuſe, than now there can. Becauſe This was a matter, which our Lord had ſo often foretold ſhould certainly be; and ſo earneſtly enjoyned all his Diſciples to look and to prepare for. The Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of this Shock ought to have been prevented by thoſe many Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. XVI.</note>, and the ſharp rebuke to this Apoſtle in particular, for not credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bitter things foretold concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf: All which had been awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened again. and their memories re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed by the <note n="†" place="margin">V. 27, &amp;c. John XIV, XV, XVI.</note> Diſcourſe of that very Evening, while his Paſſion was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49873:77"/> on. St. <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. X.</note> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> had likewiſe been told over and over, that Hatred and Perſecution and Contempt muſt be the portion of the firſt Planters of the Goſpel; That they muſt follow their Maſter, in his Sufferings no leſs than in his Virtues: That they ſhould be brought before Kings, and Rulers, and Synagogues for his Name's ſake; but even in this diſtreſs they were forewarned whom they <note n="†" place="margin">Luke XII. 5.</note> 
               <hi>ought to fear;</hi> not them that kill the Body, and after <hi>that they have no more that they can do; but Him only, who after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into Hell.</hi> This, one would imagine, might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired him with Courage, although he had been brought into the utmoſt hazards. But that was not now his Condition. He ſuffered nothing in his own perſon; He only ſaw his Maſter ſuffer; He only ſaw him ſuffer what he had frequently and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally been told muſt of neceſſity be. And though ſuch barbarous Treatment might threaten his Diſciples, and ſhew them what they were to expect when it came to their turn; Yet all this was at a diſtance. None of it as yet was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; St. <hi>Peter</hi> was not ſo much as
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49873:78"/> taken into Cuſtody, He was not called before the High Prieſt, nor examined by any Officer or Perſon in Authority. Only ſome of the Inferiour Servants officiouſly put this Queſtion; and He, who juſt before had withſtood a band of armed men, is now ſo terrified with the impertinent Jealouſies of a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant Servants, and a poor ſilly Maid; that he labours to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Them with a moſt ſhameleſs flaſhood; <note n="*" place="margin">Verſ. 67, 68.</note> 
               <hi>I know not neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand I what thou ſayeſt;</hi> that is, My being with <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the Garden, or retaining to him, is ſo far from having any truth in it, that I am abſolutely a Stranger to Him, and to the thing you charge me with.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> did not content himſelf with making this Denial Once; but repeated and perſiſted in it. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Curioſity, or Affection rather, drew him to the High Prieſt's Palace, <note n="†" place="margin">Matth. XXVI. 58.</note> 
               <hi>that he might ſee the End,</hi> it is certain this unſeaſonable Officiouſneſs placed him in the way of a Danger, which by his Abſence might have been avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But even after his firſt Denial, he is ſaid <note n="‖" place="margin">Verſ. 68.</note> 
               <hi>to have gone out,</hi> and to have heard the Cock crow without any
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49873:78"/> manner of Impreſſion. So far from this, that he returns again, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles with the ſame Company. Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, probably, that withdrawing might increaſe their Suſpicion; and chuſing rather to intangle himſelf in the ſame ſnare a ſecond time, and to gain credit by freſh and more obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate denials; than to leave any Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of his having ſaid an Untruth before. And thus One Lye was added for a Confirmation to a former; and Each repeated with greater eagerneſs and vehemence, and in Terms more expreſs and peremptory; till Three diſtinct denials had left him paſt the excuſe of Slips in memory, or Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency, or the Suddeneſs of a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, which a ſingle Denial might have received ſome Mitigation from Nay</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Which is yet a more grievous degree of Guilt, St. <hi>Peter</hi> bound theſe denials upon himſelf with voluntary Oaths and Curſes, and uſed ſuch Forms and ſuch Solemnity, to get a moſt notorious Falſhood believed, as were not lawful for him to have recourſe to, in Confirmation of the Truth it ſelf. And what could be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49873:79"/> more dreadful, than thus to call God as a Witneſs, and to imprecate his Judgment upon his own head, in a thing ſo utterly falſe? A thing, which he ſhould have been ſo far from deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering himſelf from the Suſpicion of; that he ought to have eſteemed it his Honour and greateſt Advantage; and to have owned his Diſcipleſhip to Chriſt, even at the utmoſt hazard, even at the certain expence, of his very Life. Such were the ſad Circumſtances of this Apoſtle's Fall; So unworthy a Perſon of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Eminence, Provoked by ſo ſlight an occaſion in compariſon of what might happened to him; So ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately falſe the Renouncings of his Maſter, ſo impious and blaſphemous his Perjuries againſt him. All which I have thus repreſented before you, as the Evangeliſts themſelves have done to the whole World, not with any envvious deſign of leſſening your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem for this glorious Saint, or any malicious Satisfaction that ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are apt to take, when they ſhow the actions of others in their worſt Light; but that, by ſeeing this Action in its blackeſt Colours, we may profit by his Sin, be inſtructed by his Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49873:79"/> and ſtand the faſter for his Fall. To which purpoſe the Remainder of this Diſcourſe ſhall be ſpent in ſuch uſeful Reflections and Inferences, as the former Particulars, when rightly conſidered, give us great ground for, and plain Intimations of. And They are ſuch as follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We read this Paſſage to very little Purpoſe, if it do not convince us of the miſerable Frailty even of the Beſt Men, and effectually overthrow all thoſe vain Confidences, which are apt to riſe in our hearts, from our own ſuppoſed Strength and Virtue. For, What a lamentable inſtance is there now before our Eyes, of one of the Greateſt men that ever was, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the moſt ſcandalous manner? Who ſhall hereafter dare to depend upon the higheſt degree of Knowledge, when One ſo wiſe, ſo perfectly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Chriſtian Truth, was yet, in deſpight of the fulleſt Convictions of his own Conſcience, driven to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and abjure the Lord that taught, the Lord that bought him? Who may preſume upon his beſt Reſolutions, when He, who declared ſo firm a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of adhering to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49873:80"/> any Terrours or Afflictions that could poſſibly befall him for ſuch Perſeverance, did yet within a few hours ſo premptorily, ſo ſolemnly diſown that very Perſon, for whom he ſo lately was ready to lay down his Life; and ſo did that very thing which he but juſt before was diſpoſed rather to die, than to do? I ſay was <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>diſpoſed;</hi> For there is no doubt, but St. <hi>Peter</hi> at that time ſpoke the very Senſe of his Soul, that he had an honeſt and ſincere mind, and was ſtedfaſtly determined in his own Breaſt, and thought himſelf ſufficient, to make good to the uttermoſt, what he with ſo much Piety and Affection intended and profeſſed. But here was the Errour, Here the Misfortune, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> over-lookt the infirmities of humane Nature, and, in the warmth of his Zeal, promiſed more than he was able to perform. He relyed upon his own Integrity; and thought, that good reſolutions were an impregnable defence againſt the moſt violent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations. But when the Aſſault was made, and that danger drew up cloſe to him, which he at a diſtance deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; then the Event proved, that,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49873:80"/> how willing and well reſolved ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Spirit</hi> might be, yet the <hi>Fleſh</hi> alas is but weak; at the beſt exceeding frail and weak. And, if this Great Champion ſo ſoon gave ground, How ſhall We be able to ſtand in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel? We, who are Men as well as He, nay, who are Men not near ſo well appointed as He, for this Spiritual Combat? For We have all the ſame Principle of Corruption to betray us, the ſame Paſſions to bear us down; but very Few of Us, (it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) have the ſame Knowledge and Wiſdom, the ſame Courage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, the ſame Zeal and entire Love for our Maſter, that He had, to oppoſe againſt the Tryals, which make head againſt us. But Few of Us, I doubt, have the Grace, even in cold blood, to reſolve that we would <hi>die with</hi> Chriſt, <hi>rather than deny him in any wiſe.</hi> And yet, even thoſe that are never ſo ſerious and ſincere in ſuch purpoſes, know not what will become of them, when they are brought to the proof. We are, it may be, apt to blame or to pity this Apoſtle; and may fancy, how much more valiantly we ſhould have acquitted our ſelves
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49873:81"/> under the like Difficulties; But how extreamly vain all ſuch Deſpiſings of Others, or the Preferring our own Virtue before Theirs are, this ſad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment inſtructs us. For He, who declared, that though <hi>all ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended yet would not He,</hi> fell more ſhamefully than any of the reſt, whoſe Conſtancy he ſuſpected, and engaged ſo far to excel. That very Argument he went upon proved his ruine, and the Opinion of his own Strength was the true Reaſon, why he was ſo ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly weak. So very dangerous it is to think our ſelves Something, when in truth we are Nothing. So fatal, to lean to our own Underſtanding, and be Wiſe, and Good, and Safe in our own conceits, when in reallity all our Sufficiency, all our Safety, is entirely of God. So much do even our Excellencies expoſe us, and ſuch cruel Advantages does the Tempter take from our beſt Diſpoſitions and Actions, if we grow too ſenſible of them, too well pleaſed with them, proud or careleſs upon their account; If we impute them to our ſelves, if we aſcribe the Succeſs and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we have formerly attained, to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49873:81"/> our own Virtue; and rely upon the Stedfaſtneſs of our own minds for a Security againſt future Tryals. So dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent a thing it is to defy Difficulties at a diſtance, and engage them hand to hand; To gain imaginary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and triumph in the falſe and fanciful Notions of our own Strength, and to ſuſtain the fatigues and hazards of the Field in good earneſt. In a word, ſo mortifying an Example of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Security, is that baffled Apoſtle, who undertook for ſo much, and yet performed ſo very little; So effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally did his own Experience teach Him, and ſo ſeaſonably hath he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Us, <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 5.</note> that They who are <hi>kept unto Salvation</hi> are <hi>kept through Faith, and by the Power of God.</hi> This alone is a Preſervative ſufficient againſt the Force and Subtlety of thoſe Enemies, that labour our Deſtruction. There is a ſecret hand that works with us, and inſenſibly directs, and over-rules, and eſtabliſhes our hearts. If we go right, it is becauſe Grace ſteers our Courſe, and guides our weak unwary ſteps. If we chuſe the better part, it is becauſe God inclines our Wills. If we eſcape Temptations, it is owing to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49873:82"/> an inviſible watchful Guard, who puts by many a deſperate Thruſt, and ſhields us from all the Artillery diſcharged at us by the Prince of Darkneſs. If we maintain our Ground, when they aſſail us, it is, becauſe God ſupports us with Courage, confirms our unſtable Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and enables to perſevere, and gives us Victory in the <hi>Day</hi> of Battel. Suſtained by theſe Divine Succours, we are more than Conquerors; but when thoſe are, either not lent at all, or drawn off again, we are miſerable, and blind, feeble and naked, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a cheap and eaſy Prey. And drawn off they will be, when men diſregard Them, and depend upon themſelves. For the proper Seaſon of <hi>God's Strength being manifeſted</hi> is in <hi>Our Weakneſs,</hi> and we are ſtrongeſt in effect, when moſt wretched and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent in our own eſteem. Had St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Apprehenſion of danger, and diffidence of his own abilities been greater, the iſſue of his Conflict had been leſs diſhonourable. But by the inglorious defeat of a Leader ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned and gallant for the main, God hath taught us, how wretched the Beſt of Men are, when left to ſtand upon
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49873:82"/> their Own bottom. That He, who builds upon any Attainments, any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies merely Humane, muſt expect the Fate of a tottering and ſandy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and, that there is no Rock but Divine Grace, that can weather out the Shocks of Winds and Waves. That, in all our Spiritual Encounters it is the ſafeſt and the prudenteſt thing we can do, to diſtruſt our own Abilities, to watch and pray; To watch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, becauſe we are frail and apt to be overtaken; To pray fervently, becauſe without our asking we cannot obtain that Aſſiſtance, which if we fail of, we are unavoidably vanquiſhed. And therefore, if at any time we come off with Honour and Succeſs, <hi>Not unto <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, O Lord, not unto <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, but unto thy Name be the Praiſe.</hi> For we are not able to ſtand before the mighty force that cometh againſt us, neither <hi>is it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> and therefore can never truſt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49873:83"/> Our Selves too little, or Him too much.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us from this Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple learn to conſult our Safety, by keeping, as much as is poſſible, out of the way of Temptation. St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to have run himſelf into Danger, by an unſeaſonable Inſtance of Affection for his Maſter; and Many well intending men are in like manner entangled in difficulties, by giving raſh and hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Proofs of their Zeal. We are commanded to pray, <hi>that God would not lead us into Temptation,</hi> but all Prayer ſuppoſes our own endeavours to obtain the Bleſſing we pray for, And therefore we muſt not expect to be heard, if we lead our ſelves into Temptation, and ruſh upon Miſchieſs which we might avoid. There are but very few of ſo confirmed a Virtue, as to be fit to bid the Enemy Battel, or to hold out againſt great and hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Encounters; and therefore the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Courſe is to act altogether upon the Defenſive; to look well before us, and ſtand at a diſtance. Little do men conſider what they do, when they indulge themſelves in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to Sin, and venture to play
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49873:83"/> upon the Brink of the Precipice. While we are cool, and nothing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſes our Spirits, we are apt to take falſe meaſures of our Abilities; and fondly to imagine, that we ſhall be capable of the ſame juſt Reaſonings and regular Management, in the heat of Action, as we find before we come to engage. But alas! when once the Fight begins we are quite other men; All is preſently Rout and Confuſion; Our Minds are diſordered, our Paſſions enflamed, our Sufferings preſs hard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Fleſh and Blood, our Fears or our Pleaſures bear down upon us, and, in deſpight of all our boaſted Valour, we give ground. It is therefore a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary effect of Diſtruſting our own Strength urged in my Laſt Particular; that we run as few Riſques, as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly we can: That we labour, as much as may be, to ſubdue our Paſſions, and even, when we ſeem to have them in moſt abſolute Subjection, that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them not to riſe in Rebellion againſt us: That we ask and improve the Grace of God to the utmoſt of our Power; but, when we are endued with it moſt plentifully, that we put it upon no deſperate Experiments.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49873:84"/> The Conduct of a Wiſe and Good Chriſtian is like that of a Peaceable Prince, who gets himſelf Glory by maintaining his own Territories in Quiet and good Order, rather than by affecting to enlarge them at the expence of Blood and Treaſure; and the unneceſſary Danger of loſing his Own, while he makes War upon O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. When the Providence of God brings Tryals upon us, (Which it does when our Prayers and Prudence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevent them) We may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hope, that this Grace will be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, in our reſcue from Difficulties of his own ſending. But there is not the ſame Aſſurance due to thoſe Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which our own Forwardneſs, and Indiſcretion involves us in. For God hath no-where promiſed to work Miracles for our Deliverance, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to ſave Them who are not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſave themſelves. And therefore we muſt uſe all poſſible Caution; and decline as much as may be all hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous accidents. We muſt not court opportunities of diſtinguiſhing our Chriſtian Bravery, when our Duty does not call us to it. Our Lord hath commanded us to take up our Croſs,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49873:84"/> when he lays it in our way; but he hath not commanded, that we ſhould go out and ſeek it, any, or that we ſhould meet it, when we can paſs by another way, and honeſtly and with a good Conſcience eſcape from it. He hath promiſed to <hi>ſuccour them that are tempted,</hi> that is, ſuch as are purely paſſive in the thing. But when Men break their Ranks, and, without Orders from their Commander, will needs march up as it were to the mouth of a loaded Cannon, by turning their own Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters; This is not Courage but Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardineſs. And whatever Expectations theſe Men may cheriſh of God's Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſuch Caſes, they are not the Effects of a vigorous Faith and well grounded Truſt, but of a blind and hot-headed Preſumption. For all the Promiſes of Grace, and our Belief of them, ſuppoſe the Uſe of proper Means; And of thoſe means the Firſt and Beſt is, To prevent our danger. And, as no Man in his Senſes would venture the breaking a Leg or an Arm in Confidence of his Chirurgeon's Skill to ſet it again: So neither will any conſiderate Chriſtian lay himſelf open to Sin, or make needleſs Approaches
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49873:85"/> toward it, becauſe he knows that God is more powerful to preſerve, than the Devil can be to deſtroy. For it is not the Power of God that is our Security, but the Knowing that he will exert that Power on our Behalf. And this we cannot know, but rather the direct contrary, when the Temptation is our own act and deed. For the dangers, which We chuſe, have no right to his Protection; and it is a righteous thing with Him to ſuffer ſuch men as wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly ſet their Souls at ſtake, to <hi>eat the bitter fruit of their own ways, and be filled with their own fooliſh devices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Warineſs I have been adviſing to keep aloof from Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation may yet be farther inforced, by conſidering, from this Inſtance of the Apoſtle before us, how the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of one Sin draws us on to more and greater. Thus He, after One denyal, proceeded to a Second and a Third, and did not ſtick to ſtrengthen them with falſe Oaths and horrid Curſes. And thus, in Other caſes, when men have once let go their hold, they are carried as it were down the ſtream, and let themſelves drive, till at laſt they ſink into the groſſeſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49873:85"/> Impieties. This is the natural effect of ſinful Acts; that they quickly grow into Habits, weaken and waſte the Conſcience, harden men by Cuſtom, and by degrees deſtroy their very Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. But eſpecially, when they ſuffer themſelves to do an ill thing for the eſcaping ſome preſent Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if then they feel their Danger continue or increaſe, they imagine themſelves under a neceſſity of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bolder as they are more preſs'd. And, having gone too far to retreat with Honour or Safety, endeavour to diſengage themſelves by more grievous and obſtinate degrees of Sin. There is not in the whole World a more aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned Wretch, than He that is forced to drudge on in a Courſe of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by the difficulty and the ſhame of retracting his former Errours. No man knows what ſuch an embroyled State will grow to, or where the Man will ſtop. That Principle which ſhould have preſerved him is given up; and when the Reproaches of his own mind are broken through, he lies at the mercy of every freſh Temptation, and wants only opportunities of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming every day worſe and more
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49873:86"/> profligate. And This is very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, as in all other caſes, ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the caſe of Lying, which comes neareſt to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s in my Text. How confidently men will ſtand in defence of Falſhood, and what pains they often take to gain Credit, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating and confirming what they have ſaid or done amiſs; and how quickly this ſettles into a habit of Falſhood till they ſeem at laſt to have loſt and laid aſide all regard to Honeſty and Truth, the Checks of Conſcience, or the Vengeance of Almighty God: And, yet the Event at laſt is like that of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Denials here; to entangle themſelves faſter in the ſnare; and the more they ſtruggle to get quit of their Difficulties, the more to aggravate their Sin, and expoſe their Reputations. So that, after all, the wiſeſt and ſafeſt, as well as the ſhorteſt Courſe, is to ſtick faſt to our Duty. For Truth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty will carry us through, where all the Shifts and Shufflings of wicked Craft will forſake and betray us. And it were well, if Servants, and Children, and ſuch as are under Authority; or indeed Any, who lie under the fears of danger or diſpleaſure, would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49873:86"/> this matter duly. For, beſides the great Offence which lying Excuſes are to Almighty God, every Maſter, or Perſon with whom we have to deal, cannot but think the Fault and Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doubled by this means. And no Man of Reaſon or common Senſe, can ſuppoſe himſelf ſecure of our Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Service or Intereſt, if he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in us a diſpoſition, upon every ſlight occaſion, to deal indirectly; that we make no bones of ſacrificing Truth to Reſpect, and being unfaithful to the Witneſs within our own Breaſts, and our great Lord and Maſter in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> From hence we may be able to ſatisfy our ſelves of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs of God, in cauſing the Faults and Infirmities of his Saints, to be recorded in Holy Scripture, and the Uſe we ought to make of their Failings and Temptations. Not to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our ſelves in any manner of Evil, as if We might notwithſtanding be dear and acceptable to God. For theſe men were ſo upon the account of their Eminent Virtues, and their as Eminent Repentance, where they did amiſs; Otherwiſe the Threatning in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:49873:87"/> had been their Portion, <note place="margin">Ezek. XVIII. 24.</note> 
               <hi>All their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Righteouſneſs ſhould not have been mentioned</hi> in the Day of Account, but in the <hi>treſpaſs and the Sin which they have ſinned, in theſe they ſhould have died.</hi> But This was done for a ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Warning, and to be an effectual Humiliation to all future Ages; by letting us ſee, that the moſt Perfect of Men are ſtill but Men; Subject to mighty Blemiſhes and Imperfections; and that the higheſt and moſt purified State we can poſſibly arrive at in this World, is no Security from Danger. This ſhould make us very tender, how we judge and deſpiſe our Brethren; Whoſe Faults, how ſeverely ſoever we may think fit to cenſure, it is highly probable would be our own; were Their Circumſtances and Their Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Ours. This alſo confutes the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Some, who teach, that They, who have true Faith and true Grace, can never fall from it. An Opinion extreamly falſe, and groundleſs. For What is true Faith and true Grace, if that Confeſſion of St. <hi>Peter</hi> did not ſhew it, which our Lord ſo highly commended, declared he would build his Church upon, and pronounced
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49873:87"/> him Bleſſed for? And What is Falling from ſuch Grace and Faith, if the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate repeated denying, and abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Chriſt be not? Theſe Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therefore of ſuch Worthies miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying ſo groſly ring in our Ears thoſe Admonitions of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. XI. 20. 1 Cor. X. 12. Gal. VI. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Be not high-minded but fear, and Let Him that thinketh he ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall,</hi> and <hi>If a man be overtaken in a Fault, reſtore ſuch a one with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Meekneſs conſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted.</hi> They forbid us to promiſe our ſelves Safety and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Temptation in any Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of humane Life; Or ſo far to preſume upon our former Virtues, as to think our ſelves incapable even of the blackeſt Vices, if God ſhould withdraw his Grace from us, and leave us to our own poor Powers, and unwary Meaſures. They awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our Care, mortify our Vanity, and remind us of our Dependance upon a Higher Power, and to give Him the Acknowledgments due for all the Good we do, and for all the Evil we do not. And, as they admoniſh, ſo do they comfort us too, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that God does not utterly caſt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49873:88"/> off his Servants, no not when they offend very grievouſly and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly. That we need not, ought not to deſpair, though our Tranſgreſſions be very many, very heinous, ſince there is ſtill Room left for ſecond and better Thoughts; And, provided Men return and endeavour to make amends for their paſt Offences, they ſhall be kindly received, and freely pardoned. And therefore, when we read This and the like Paſſages, we muſt be ſure not to ſtop in the midſt, but take in the whole Relation, and obſerve the Character throughout. For St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fall will miniſter juſt ground of Comfort, to None, but ſuch as are careful to riſe with him again. His Sin indeed is a Warning to us, but his Repentance is no leſs a Pattern. They that blame his Sin, will do well to obſerve his Sorrow; and if they abhor the One, they will not perhaps find it ſo eaſy to imitate the Other. Let us remember, that there are ſeveral ways of denying God and Chriſt, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly ſays, <hi>They do it in works</hi> and in effect, who do not live according to what they believe. This I am afraid Few, if Any
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49873:88"/> of us can purge our ſelves wholly of; and therefore, ſince our guilt is not far from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, but only doing the ſame thing after another faſhion; it will be neceſſary, that our Concern and Reformation ſhould come up as near to His, as the nature of the Fault does. In order whereunto, My ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Head propoſes to treat of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Repentance. And that (God willing) ſhall be the Buſineſs of my next Diſcourſe.</p>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the Former of theſe, I have already ſpoken at large; And ſhall now proceed to the Latter;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49873:89"/> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Repentance. And here I ſhall obſerve the ſame method as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Conſidering carefully the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Steps and Parts of this Repentance in the <hi>firſt</hi> place; and then drawing from this Example ſuch Reflections as are proper to the Occaſion, and may be uſeful to all Chriſtians in general, More eſpecially to Such, whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Engagements in a ſinful Courſe have rendred a very deep and ſolemn Repentance neceſſary, for reſtoring them to the Favour of an offended God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt</hi> then, Let us conſider this Repentance ſo far as St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf was concerned in it. And here it may be convenient to take notice of the <hi>Four</hi> following Particulars. Which, though not all expreſſed in the words before us, yet are to be gathered plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the Relations which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evangeliſts have left us concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Matter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Now the <hi>Firſt</hi> thing obſervable here, is That, which gave the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to this Change. And This we are told by all the Evangeliſts was the Crowing of the Cock. But St. <hi>Mark</hi> hath informed us <note n="*" place="margin">Verſ. 68.</note> particularly, that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49873:90"/> St. <hi>Peter</hi> had heard him Crow once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without any manner of Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And therefore St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives us a very good Intimation, how the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating it a Second time came to be more effectual than the Firſt. For this Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt is ſingular in one Circumſtance, mentioned (<hi>Ch.</hi> XXII. 61.) <hi>The Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then remembred the word of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. So that this Glance of our Lord upon St. <hi>Peter</hi> falling in ſo ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably with that Crowing of the Cock, awakened his mind, and made him attend to that Signal of his Duty, that Remembrancer of the fault our Lord had foretold, and He had ſo ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfilled. This then ſo backed, ſo ſent home to his Conſcience put him upon the <hi>Second</hi> thing remarkable,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Which is, His own Recollection. <hi>He remembred the word that Jeſus had ſaid,</hi> and found, by comparing his own Behaviour with it, how ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully he had fallen from his boaſted Courage and Conſtancy, How frail and unſtable his ſtrongeſt Reſolutions had proved; How much better our Lord underſtood him, than he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood himſelf; How very quickly, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49873:90"/> eaſily he had been betrayed into a Crime, of which he could not believe himſelf capable; How baſe he had been to ſo kind a Maſter; How falſe to his own purpoſes; How regardleſs of Truth, How peremptory in a moſt notorious Falſhood; How profane in the Oaths and Curſes, by which he had bound it upon his Conſcience. For by this Remembrance, and Thought, no doubt is intended a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to himſſlf the Offence he had committed, in its blackeſt Colours; and loading it with all the dreadful Aggravations, which of right belonged to it. All which, when ſet before him, proved ſo frightful a Spectacle, that he could no longer refrain from Tears; for that is the</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Third</hi> Circumſtance obſervable in his Behaviour. When he <hi>thought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he wept,</hi> or as ſome underſtand it, he burſt out into Tears immediately: Intimating hereby both the Suddenneſs, and the Extremity of his Grief; Such as ſought a convenient place to give it ſelf free vent in; and therefore <hi>he went <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and wept bitterly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without entring into the Diſpute, what may be the propereſt Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49873:91"/> of thoſe words by which St. <hi>Mark</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </note> hath deſcribed this Action, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently manifeſt, that St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Reflection upon what he had done produced in him this Sorrow, and that his Sorrow was very ſerious and hearty. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Horrours of his mind expreſſing themſelves by the abundance of his Tears, and all other Marks of bitter Remorſe, which we can ſuppoſe his Condition to require, or be capable of. And This muſt needs have been more than can be eaſy for us to conceive. For the Anguiſh of a wounded Spirit is no more to be deſcribed, than it is to be born. And in St. <hi>Peter</hi> every thing conſpired to increaſe this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. For, beſides the many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Circumſtances, that heightned his Guilt, and embittered the Remembrance of ſo foul an Offence; the very Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Maſter, who in the midſt of Contumelies and Sufferings ſeem'd to forget himſelf a while, and had a Compaſſionate Look in reſerve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim Him, muſt needs have added a great deal to his Aſtoniſhment and Concern. There being nothing more apt to ſoften and melt a Man's heart down, and reduce him to an effectual
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49873:91"/> Senſe of his own Vileneſs and Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, than ſome very undeſerved Kindneſs of a Perſon, whom he hath heinouſly injured. And what greater Indignity could St. <hi>Peter</hi> put upon his Lord, than thus to diſown and abjure him? What greater Kindneſs could our Lord ſhew to this revolting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Man, than, by the ſilent but ſignificant Rebuke of his Eye caſt that way, ſo opportunely to call him back to himſelf? And what could cut St. <hi>Peter</hi> more to the quick, than ſuch an Inſtance of Mercy and Tenderneſs? Such as ſhewed a greater Concern for his Diſciples Sin, than for all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and Inſolence of his Enemies to himſelf; Such as declared, though that wicked Servant had diſclaimed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, yet that He was ſo gracious, as not even thus to diſcard and forſake Him. This, I make no doubt, was one of the bittereſt Ingredients in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and that which confirmed him in his Duty ever after, as much as any other Conſideration whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And this puts me in mind of a <hi>Fourth</hi> thing very neceſſary to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (which, though not mentioned here, yet is abundantly evident from
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49873:92"/> other Paſſages of the New Teſtament) and that is, the Thorough Change wrought in St. <hi>Peter</hi> by this Godly Sorrow; and the ample Amends he afterwards made for all the Diſhonour this Denial of Chriſt could poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon Himſelf, his Maſter, or the Chriſtian Religion. For, immediately after our Lord's Reſurrection, we find the ſame ardent Affection flaming out again as bright as ever. This <note n="*" place="margin">John XXI. 7.</note> once diſmayed St. <hi>Peter,</hi> did then caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Sea, out of Impatience to haſten to Jeſus upon the Shore; He put himſelf forward <note n="†" place="margin">Acts II. 14.</note> on the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> and, with undaunted Zeal, aſſerted the Reſurrection and Divinity of that Saviour, whom he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied. He <note n="‖" place="margin">Acts IV. 19, 20.</note> maintained his Point againſt the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rulers, deſpiſed their Rebukes and angry Menaces, and plainly told them, that <hi>God was to be obeyed rather than Men,</hi> and therefore whatever it coſt him, He could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid himſelf, publickly declaring the Truths which he had ſeen and heard. He <note n="*" place="margin">Acts IV. 23. 1ſt and 2d Epiſt.</note> ſtrengthened the Brethren by his reſolute Behaviour, led them on brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and took all poſſible care to keep them from ſhrinking at the Terrours
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49873:92"/> of Perſecution. He perſiſted in his preaching, and when the Enemies of the Faith were not to be reaſoned out of their malice, moſt willingly offered his Perſon to ſcourging and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <note n="*" place="margin">Acts V. 40, 41.</note> 
               <hi>rejoycing that he was counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for the</hi> once abjured <hi>Name of Jeſus:</hi> He was the Mark of Envy and Rage, ſingled <note n="†" place="margin">Acts XII. 4.</note> out by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> for a Sacrifice, that would above all others content the <hi>Jews;</hi> And therefore was intended to gratify their Spight, by making his Death add to the Triumphs and ſolemn Rejoycings of their Paſſover. And, though God ſaw fit to diſappoint that Deſign, and reſerve him for more and greater Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to the Chriſtian Cauſe; yet did he at laſt glorify him, <note n="‖" place="margin">John XXI. 18, 19.</note> by the ſame kind of Tortures and Death, which his Maſter condeſcended to undergo; nay, St. <hi>Peter</hi> gladly received the notice of this from Chriſt's own mouth. So that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was not more different from himſelf, when trembling at the Voice of a ſilly Damſel; than the ſame St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> afterwards, the Glorious, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Apoſtle, before the Council, in Priſons, and upon the Croſs, was from the Cowardly, the Infamous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negade
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49873:93"/> in the High Prieſts Hall. This ſettled and deliberate Fidelity was a noble Compenſation for the Infirmity, and Fears, and violent Tranſport of his Fall. This ſhewed what the Man was, when perfectly himſelf, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Grace of God; As the Other did, what he was, when naked and deſtitute of Heavenly Succours; depending upon his own Strength, and left in the hand of his Paſſions. This reſtored him to Favour, and hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed his Honour to all Eternity. And we ſhould not have done right to St. <hi>Peter</hi> in handling the Caſe now before us, ſhould theſe laſt and Finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scenes of his Life have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Becauſe whatever he had done amiſs through Frailty and hurry, he thus undid again, in cool, and ſtaid, and deliberate Acts. And, ſince Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is an Alteration of the Man, of his whole Temper, and Behaviour; I thought my ſelf bound to ſet before you ſome of thoſe Inſtances, which the Holy Ghoſt hath left upon Record, of the Efficacy and Sincerity of this Man's Repentance. And Bound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I eſteem my ſelf, not only in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to the Memory of this Eminent
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49873:93"/> Apoſtle, but for Your ſakes too; in regard of thoſe Uſes and Inſtructions that are capable of being drawn from hence. For That is the next thing I am now applying my ſelf to; The making ſome Reflections upon St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Repentance, of which all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's may profit themſelves, who read and conſider it with ſerious and due Attention.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Inſtance before us, it will be no hard matter to poſſeſs our minds with a right Notion of the Promiſes of God to Good Men, with regard to Temptations. He hath not engaged, that our Virtue ſhall never be brought into hazard; for This would prevent the Proofs of our Fidelity to him, which is chiefly ſeen in our Conſtancy under thoſe Tryals that endanger it. And therefore in this caſe we are to ſupport our Spirits, with thoſe Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of his Grace, which may enable us to reſiſt Temptations. Nay, he hath not aſſured us, we ſhall always be ſucceſsful in our Reſiſtance, when thus aſſaulted; but thinks it ſufficient Encouragement, that, if through the Infirmity of our Corrupt Nature, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49873:94"/> the Violence of our Temptations, we happen to be overcome and fall into Sin, his Grace ſhall not be wanting to raiſe us again by Repentance. Thus our Lord tells St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Luke XXII. 32.</note> that he had <hi>prayed for him</hi> that <hi>his Faith might not fail;</hi> that is, that he might not fall away finally. His Faith we ſee did fail for a Seaſon; for ſuch peremptory Denials of our Lord could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with that ſaving Principle. But That, which received ſo terrible a damp by this Interruption, was not utterly loſt and extinguiſhed in his mind. The Diſtemper in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was Mortal, but, by the Power, and Skill, and timely Application of his Spiritual Phyſician, it received a perfect Cure. Chriſt therefore did not pray for the Prevention of his Sin, but for his Converſion from, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment after it. And this was every whit as much for the Benefit of the Patient, and the Honour of the Divine Grace, as the preſerving him in perfect Health and Soundneſs could poſſibly have been. Nay, more indeed, both for the One and the Other. For the greater the Danger was, the more clearly does the Sovereign Virtue and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49873:94"/> Efficacy of the Remedy appear. The Grace of God is never ſo conſpicuous, never triumphs ſo gloriouſly over the Powers of Satan, as when it revives wretched Offenders from the <hi>Death of Sin unto the Life of Righteouſneſs.</hi> And the grievous Miſcarriages of Good Men are often ſo ordered, as to turn to their mighty Advantage. For Theſe have a natural Tendency to awaken their care; they make them more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their own Weakneſs and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and more vigilant to prevent it for the time to come, than otherwiſe they would have been, if their own Experience had not taught them, upon what ſlippery Ground they ſtand. They diſpoſe them to be more tender and compaſſionate to their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; more gentle and ſparing in their Cenſures; more ready to forgive what is done amiſs; more diligent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute their endeavours for the reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and <hi>reſtoring ſuch in the Spirit of Meekneſs;</hi> when they reflect how eaſy it is to be overtaken, and how prone All, even the Beſt Men, are to offend. And they kindle in ſuch Penitents a vigorous and active Zeal, to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the ſcandal of a bad Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49873:95"/> by a ſtricter Holineſs, and brighter Virtues for the time to come. So little reaſon is there, that we ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from all Temptation, or be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from ſinning when we are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted; when the Conſequences both of the One and the Other may be, and often are, ſo managed by the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of Providence, as not only not to deſtroy or impair the Piety of private Men, but, with the Increaſe of That, to become Inſtruments of Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Good: More effectual to our own Salvation; More ſerviceable to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God and his Grace; and More beneficial to Religion in general, than if Good Men had never been tempted, or never fallen at all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes the Errour of Thoſe, who hold, that men who once have true Grace cannot loſe it, ſo St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain proves, that ſuch as have had the Unhappineſs to loſe Grace, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored and recover it again. And this overthrows the <hi>Novatian</hi> Hereſy, which conſiſted in affirming, that there is no remiſſion to be had for Sins committed after Baptiſm, and againſt which the Sixteenth Article of our Religion is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49873:95"/> levelled. An Errour, in all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, chiefly owing to the miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Interpretation of two Texts to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which have created great perplexity to ignorant and unwary Souls. <hi>The firſt is that in</hi> (Heb. VI. 4, 5, 6.) <hi>It is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightned, and have been made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Holy Ghoſt, And have taſted the good Word of God, and the powers of the world to come, If they ſhall fall away to renew them again unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> The other (Heb. X. 26, 27.) <hi>If we ſin wilfully after that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for Sins: But a certain fearful looking for of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fiery Indignation, which ſhall devour the Adverſaries.</hi> Now for a right Underſtanding of theſe Paſſages, we are to obſerve theſe Three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Scripture often expreſſes that by <hi>Impoſſible</hi> which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly difficult: Or which is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for humane Strength only, but not ſo to Nature aſſiſted by Divine Grace. And thus our Bleſſed Saviour explains himſelf concerning <hi>Rich</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. XIX. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Mens en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Kingdom of God;</hi> by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that though this be <hi>impoſſible</hi> with
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49873:96"/> regard to the Corruptions and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſuch Perſons, and any Power of their own to reſiſt, and vanquiſh them, yet <note n="*" place="margin">Luke XVIII. 27.</note> 
               <hi>the things that are impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with Men are poſſible with God.</hi> He may, by the prevailing influencces of his Grace, wean their hearts from the World, and effectually diſpoſe them to accept ſuch Terms of Salvation, as of themſelves they would never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline or ſubmit to. And thus, though men who reject and quench the Holy Spirit by wilful Sin, cannot renew themſelves, yet God can give them the Heart and Power of Repentance and Renovation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Apoſtle, addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Jews,</hi> ſpeaks with alluſion to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which, though it allowed of Sacrifices for the Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Involuntary Sins, ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from Ignorance or Infirmity, yet did not make the like Proviſion for wilful, and deliberate, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Offences. But that This is not to be ſo ſtrictly taken, as if the Chriſtian Diſpenſation had made no Proviſion for even ſuch neither, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from that Argument, <note n="*" place="margin">Act. XIII. 38, 39.</note> whereby the ſame Apoſtle proves the Excellence
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49873:96"/> of Ours, above the Levitical Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Be it known unto you, that through this man</hi> (Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>is preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you Forgiveneſs of Sins; And by Him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye could not be juſtified by the Laws of Moſes.</hi> If therefore men might, even by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> be juſtified from thoſe Sins which were not wilful; and if by Faith in Chriſt men may be juſtified from all things, which by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> they could not be juſtified from; It follows, that, by the Evangelical Covenant, even Wilful Sins are capable of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in them that believe. I ſay, <hi>in them that believe,</hi> for, to remove this Difficulty effectually, we muſt obſerve,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That thoſe Texts to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> are meant, not of every ſort of wilful Offenders, but of ſuch as revolt and fly off entirely from the Faith and Profeſſion of the Goſpel. For which reaſon they are branded with the Titles <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. X. 27, 29.</note> of <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> and ſuch <hi>as crucify the Son of God afreſh, trample him under foot, count the blood of the Covenant an unholy thing, and do deſpight to the Spirit of Grace.</hi> And theſe men, to be ſure, it is impoſſible to renew,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49873:97"/> while they continue in their Apoſtacy: Becauſe they have caſt off their only Remedy. For Faith is the indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition of Pardon, <hi>All that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve are juſtified,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul;</hi> But this Faith They have renounced and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed; and conſequently are not within the Covenant, nor under the Influence of Grace, or the Poſſibility of Benefit from the Sacrifice of that Blood, which they eſteem <hi>Common</hi> and no <hi>Sacrifice at all.</hi> But the Caſe is far otherwiſe with Them, who are engaged in a ſinful Courſe, and yet have not thrown off the Foundation of Chriſtianity. They may ſee their Folly, and acknowledge the merit of their Saviour's Atonement; They may comply with the good motions of that Spirit, which they too long have quenched and reſiſted, though they have not formally diſavowed and done publick deſpight to him. There is a mighty difference, between walking unworthy of the Chriſtian Faith, and being formal and open Adverſaries to it; Between a Converſation unbecoming the Goſpel, and Principles that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly overthrow the Goſpel. And conſequently, Thoſe Paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49873:97"/> which ſtrike at the One of theſe, and declare it incapable of Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; need not, muſt not be ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Other, as to exclude from all Hope and Comfort, a Caſe ſo very diſtant from the former.</p>
            <p>Thus much however muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, for a Terrour to all who ſhall preſume to ſin with a high hand; that the more wilful any Man's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences have been, the harder he will find it to repent, and the greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he hath to dread the being forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by God, and given up to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate mind. For God is ſo far pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked in ſome caſes, as not to afford that Grace, which is effectual to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; when obſtinate and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Wretches have long abuſed and withſtood it; Whereas he ſhews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more tender and eaſy to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, to thoſe who have Ignorance or Infirmity to plead in Mitigation of their Faults. A notable Inſtance whereof we ſhall do well to obſerve in St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi> For, though both were guilty of mortal Sin, yet the Quality of their Facts was as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, as the Event of them. St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> indeed denied our Lord baſelv,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49873:98"/> obſtinately, blaſphemouſly. But how came he to do it? He knew he ought not, he reſolved he would not, he came full of that Reſolution; But the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of his Maſter's Sufferings, and the Violence of his own Fears ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded him, that he had not his thoughts and judgment at liberty; Aſſoon as ever he was reſtored to the uſe of his reaſon, he checked and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned himſelf moſt ſeverely for what he had done. The fault was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and ended, and lamented, and all in the ſpace of an Hour or Two; And this ſhort defection was compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated by the moſt reſolute Confeſſions of <hi>Jeſus</hi> all his Life after. So that, though This were a very grievous Crime, yet there was ſomething to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the heinouſneſs of it. His Will was not principally and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily concerned, it moved not of it ſelf, but was over-born by his Affections. And this action ought in equity to be imputed, to a diſtemper of Paſſion, rather than to any ſettled Senſe of his mind. Had he been cool, and ſedate, and perfectly at his own diſpoſal, we ſhould have ſeen him quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man. And therefore <hi>Jeſus</hi> had a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49873:98"/> kind reproving look in ſtore for Him, and mercifully allowed for thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, with which the partaking of our Nature had made him ſo intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well acquainted.</p>
            <p>But we read of no ſuch Grace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to <hi>Judas,</hi> nor was there in Him the ſame pitiable Circumſtances to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it. He laboured under no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, from which his Treachery might ſeem a neceſſary Expedient to deliver him. His only Temptation was the Naughtineſs and ſordid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs of his own mind; His Wickedneſs was a Work of Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and long Contrivance, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Debate; He conſulted with the High-Prieſts and Elders, of the Time, the Place, and every Circumſtance for the moſt convenient Execution of his Villany; He ſet his own Soul and his Maſter's Life to ſale at a vile price; continued his attendance upon that Maſter ſtill; that ſo, under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of Friendſhip, and by ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured Hypocriſy, he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter carry on his deſign of deſtroying him. And, when his Project was thus formed, he had many broad hints gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> had detected his
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49873:99"/> deſigns; many warnings of the Sin and Danger he was running into; and, <hi>that it</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. XXVI. 24.</note> 
               <hi>had been better for him if he had never been born;</hi> And yet none of theſe altered his purpoſe. So that in this Act of <hi>Judas</hi> there were all the Characters of a Malice prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, a ſettled inflexible Reſolution to do wickedly. This was intirely the Work of his Will; And Such a one, as plainly ſhewed him to have caſt off all Faith in Chriſt; To intend, as much as could be, the utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Him and his Doctrine, and to have been what our Lord calls him, <note n="†" place="margin">John VI. 70, 71.</note> a <hi>Devil.</hi> And accordingly, The Regret he afterwards felt, ſeems rather to have been the effect of Confuſion, and Rage; than any godly Relenting; the Agonies of Frenzy, and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Deſpair, which are moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant things in the World from that ſober and regular Sorrow, which <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. VII. 10.</note> worketh <hi>Repentance unto Salvation not to be repented of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The deſign of this Compariſon is to beget in all that hear me a juſt abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all Wilful Sin; that None of us may dare to act, deliberately and in cold Blood, thoſe things which
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49873:99"/> our Reaſon and our Conſcience tell us ought not to be done. For, though the caſe of every wilful, no nor of every habitual Sinner, be not ſo deſperate as that of <hi>Judas;</hi> Yet we may from hence be ſenſible, that where men offend with a high hand, and in deſiance, as it were, to the Commands of God, and the Checks of their own breaſts; Where they proceed leiſurely, and have ſpace and opportunities to recollect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Where they continue long in wicked practices, and are deaf to all Admonitions, which ſhould pluck them back; Theſe men contract a very deep guilt; are much harder to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed; and may reaſonably fear, that they provoke God to withdraw thoſe Aſſiſtances and Reſtraints of Grace, which are neceſſary to their Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore <hi>David</hi> very wiſely prays to be kept <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. XIX. 13.</note> 
               <hi>from preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Sins, leſt they ſhould get the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over him,</hi> and calls <hi>theſe the Great Offence,</hi> ſuch as is moſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to Almighty God, and which he will not be eaſily pacified for. And if ſo deep a Remorſe, if ſuch bitter Tears, were thought by St. <hi>Peter</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enough for a Sin of Infirmity;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49873:100"/> What meaſure of theſe muſt needs be due, where the Will acts more freely, and the Choice of Evil is the Effect of Obſtinacy and Perverſeneſs, and a Contempt of our Duty? Certainly the leaſt we can think fit in ſuch wretched Circumſtances, is to take good heed, that none of thoſe Qualifications be wanting, in Our Repentance, which rendred that of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſo ſucceſsful. And therefore the Laſt thing I ſhall do upon this occaſion, ſhall be to ſhew, wherein this Repentance of St. <hi>Peter</hi> is, and ought to be, a Pattern to all returning Sinners.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To which purpoſe I obſerve, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that we are bound to imitate Him in theſe following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> In aſcribing the very Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to repent to the Grace and Favour of Almighty God. Some of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have not unfitly reſembled the Crowing of the Cock to the Outward, and the awakening Look, which <hi>Jeſus</hi> caſt upon St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the Inward, Call to Repentance. By the Outward Call I mean, ſuch as the Preaching of the Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Advice of our Friends, the Reproofs of thoſe in Authority, the merciful or the ſevere Diſpenſations
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49873:100"/> of Providence, inviting or driving men to better Courſes. By the Inward, thoſe kindly and ſeaſonable, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Operations of the Holy Spirit, which incline and give a right turn to our Minds, and cauſe the Outward means to make a due Impreſſion upon us. Now as the <hi>firſt</hi> Crow of the Cock had no effect upon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Jeſus</hi> did not then turn upon him; ſo theſe Outward Calls are very often unſucceſsful, becauſe not ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſent home by that Grace of God, which alone can give them pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to prevail for our Reformation. And, as the Efficacy of the <hi>Second</hi> Crowing was immediate and ſtrong, when attended with that rebuking Glance of our Bleſſed Maſter; ſo, where thoſe Outward means are back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Inward Influences of the Spirit, there they produce ſudden and wonderful Alterations. For what reaſons God vouchſafes this Inward Call to Some and not to Others, who all partake equally of the Outward Call, is beſt known to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s own Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom. Nor is it now requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to enter ſo far into that Enquiry, as we may know. This is ſufficient
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49873:101"/> for my preſent purpoſe, that the <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing men dead in treſpaſſes and Sins,</hi> and quickening them with a Principle of Spiritual and new Life, are deſcribed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Epheſ. I. 19, 20. II. 1, 5.</note> as Miracles, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than Almighty Power can do. And therefore, when we feel any Deſires and Tendencies to lead better Lives, and forſake our old Sins, let us be ſure to lay the firſt Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Repentance in Humility. Not fondly imagining, that this Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is of our ſelves: but, meekly and with all due Thankfulneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging in the Language of the ſame St. <hi>Paul;</hi> that <note n="†" place="margin">2 Cor. III. 5.</note> 
               <hi>we are not able of our ſelves ſo much as to think one good thought,</hi> and that it is <hi>God</hi> alone <note n="‖" place="margin">Phil. II. 13.</note> who <hi>worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleaſure;</hi> that <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. XV. 10.</note> 
               <hi>by the Grace of God we are what we are,</hi> and that it lies upon Us to take great care, that <hi>his Grace, which is beſtowed</hi> upon us, <hi>be not in vain.</hi> To which purpoſe,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Example teaches us, that our Repentance ought to be ſpeedy. He was no ſooner made ſenſible of his fault, but immediately he left the Scene of his Wickedneſs, broke looſe from the Company, that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49873:101"/> had drawn him into it, and betook himſelf to his Prayers and his Tears. And We in like manner, if we would approve our ſelves true Penitents, muſt ſtrike in with the very firſt Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our own minds. We muſt not tamper with our Conſciences, nor ſeek out frivolous Excuſes for defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our Reformation; but improve the Motions of Grace, and quit all occaſions of Sin; All that Company, All thoſe Pleaſures, or whatever elſe hath been a ſnare to us heretofore, muſt be wholly abandoned. Or (if that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be) ſo carefully watched, ſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly uſed, that all the Approaches and Paſſes may be guarded and block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, where the Tempter hath uſed, or is likely to break in upon us. And This is a thing that will admit of no delay, becauſe the continuing to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and approve our Sins is the ſame thing in effect with committing them over again. It argues the very ſame diſpoſition ſtill to remain. For he that is loath to part with his Vices, wants nothing but Opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them. And God, who judges us according to the Bent of our Wills, and meaſures the Good or Evil we do, by
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49873:102"/> the Degrees of Love or Hatred we bear to Him and Religion, knows very well, that They who put off their Repentance to a further day, are ſtill in <hi>the Gall of Bitterneſs and the Bond of Iniquity.</hi> Men may flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and impoſe upon Others, with I know not what idle Pretences; but He that is ſeriouſly convinced he ought to repent, and does not ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it immediately, is not in good earneſt, nor does he ſincerely hate his wicked ways, or heartily intend ever to repent at all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Bitterneſs of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Weeping inſtructs us, how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and how Eſſicacious a branch of Repentance it is, to be deeply and heartily ſorry for our Sins. This is neceſſary, becauſe we have to deal with a God to whom we are not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of bringing any Atonement; and therefore the Only Satisfaction we can make him, is the taking the Shame of our Fault to our ſelves, and being unfeignedly afflicted for all our unworthy behaviour toward him. For which reaſon the <hi>broken and contrite heart</hi> is called in a peculiar manner <hi>God's Sacrifice,</hi> and ſuch an Offering
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49873:102"/> as <hi>he will not deſpiſe.</hi> (Pſal. LI. 17.) And as ſuch Sorrow is Neceſſary, ſo is it likewiſe of great Efficacy in the preſent caſe, becauſe our Care to avoid Sin for the future, will naturally be proportionable to our Concern for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving committed it heretofore. Hence are the pious Mourners ſo bleſſed, Hence the ſhootings and ſtinging pains of a wounded Conſcience the greateſt Mercies to the Sufferer; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch pains are profitable, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting an irreconcilable and ſettled averſion againſt the wretched Cauſe of them, and firmer reſolutions to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver from ſuch ſmart and miſery, by ſeeking the <hi>peaceable fruits of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> ever after. And, becauſe ſuch inward Reproaches and Anguiſh of Heart, if the degree of This Sorrow be equal, will have the ſame natural Effects with all Other Sorrow; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are ſo often called upon for the ſame Teſtimonies of it as are uſual under Other Afflictions. Hence we are commanded to <note n="*" place="margin">Joel II. 12.</note> turn to the Lord with <hi>weeping and Mourning;</hi> Hence <hi>David waſhed his bed, and watered his Couch with Tears,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Pſal. VI. 6.</note> and Hence God is ſaid <hi>to put ſuch Tears into his bottle</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Pſal. LVI. 8.</note>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:49873:103"/> that is, To treaſure them up, and have them in favourable Remembrance; becauſe as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. VII. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row worketh Repentance.</hi> Miſtake not (my Friends.) Sorrow is not Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but works it; that is, it is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental toward it, and very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to produce it. Which leads me to a</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth</hi> thing, in which if we do not imitate St. <hi>Peter,</hi> all the reſt is of no Significance at all to us; And That is an Effectual Change of Manners, and ſtedfaſt Perſeverance in Holineſs for the time to come. And This will be the natural Conſequence of our Sorrow for Sin, if it be indeed affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and ſincere. For No Man thinks he can be too careful to avoid that, which creates him diſquiet; No Man needs be warned to keep at a diſtance from things which he hates and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends extream danger, and certain Deſtruction from. If therefore This be our real Senſe of Sin, our Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour will be agreeable to it. But, beſides the Obligation, which a due Regard to our own Safety lays upon us, we are likewiſe bound to it in
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49873:103"/> Gratitude to Almighty God. For, Which way can we expreſs our thanks for the ineſtimable mercy of being reſcued out of the Captivity of Sin and Death, ſo well as by living to Him who hath thus loved us? It is not enough in ſuch a caſe, that we refuſe to be entangled again in the ſame Yoke of Bondage. Thus much we owe to our Selves: But to Him who hath <hi>hewed our ſnares in pieces,</hi> we owe a great deal more. The greater our Debt was, the more we muſt teſtify our Affection to the kind Creditor who releaſed it. And This can only be done, by devoting our ſelves as eagerly to the Service of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as ever we had done formerly to that of our Luſts: By ſtemming the Torrent of Profaneneſs and Impiety, and endeavouring with all our might to promote Goodneſs in the World. Particularly by being eminently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in thoſe Virtues, which are moſt directly contrary to the Vices we formerly indulged, and by our active indefatigable Charity to the Souls of our Brethren, giving Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony how juſt a value we ſet upon
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49873:104"/> the deliverance of our Own, in our mighty care to reſcue Theirs.</p>
            <p>Thus far St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Example leads us. But, even when we have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it thus far, we may not ſuppoſe, that our Pardon and good Acceptance are due to any Deſert of our own Good Works; Or, that our deepeſt Sorrow can (properly ſpeaking) have in it any thing of Satisfaction. For as <note n="*" place="margin">Luke XXII. 32.</note> St. <hi>Peter's Faith did</hi> therefore <hi>not fail, becauſe Chriſt prayed that it might not;</hi> ſo our Reſtoration and the Eſſicacy of our Repentance is entirely the Effect of the Merits and Interceſſion of the ſame kind Saviour. He only could take up this quarrel between offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God and ſinful Man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when we find God moſt eaſy of Acceſs, and are ſuffered to draw ſo near, as even to be myſtically united to him, and fed by him; let us not forget to beg that the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Burden of our Sins may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, not in Preſumption of <hi>our own Righteouſneſs, but in confidence of his manifold and great Mercies:</hi> humbly beſeeching him, <hi>That for his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49873:104"/> Son our Lord Jeſus Christ's Sake, he would forgive us all that is paſt, and grant that we may ever heareafter ſerve and pleaſe Him In newneſs of Life, To the honour and glory of his holy Name, through the ſame Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>WHEN we read of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> adventuring to Viſit <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the Conviction his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles had wrought upon ſome of the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49873:105"/> Beholders; that they concluded from hence his Miſſion and Authority to be Divine, it is plain ſomewhat more than mere Curioſity drew him to this Conference. Deſires he had, though as yet but imperfect, of better Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but ſuch as they were, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did not diſdain to gratify them, in entring upon a Diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdom of God: That King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which it was his deſign to bring men to; the Kingdom of that God from whom he came a Teacher. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had enquired into the Qualifications, requiſite to prepare Men for, and admit them into this Kingdom, we know not; or whether Chriſt of his own accord fell upon This, as a Point the moſt improving, the moſt neceſſary to be firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and moſt pertinent to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſtealing this Viſit. Nor was it material for St. <hi>John</hi> to acquaint us. That which is of much greater Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is, that he makes a <hi>Man's being born again,</hi> the indiſpenſable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>ſeeing that Kingdom.</hi> (V. 3.) And This deſerves the Greater Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe a Maſter in <hi>Iſrael</hi> miſtook it; As if God had intended the Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49873:106"/> (or at leaſt our Saviour were ſo abſurd to propoſe it) of going through the Courſe of a Natural Birth the ſecond time. (V. 4.) From that wild Miſconſtruction our Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers himſelf, and explains the Nature of Regeneration. <hi>That Water and the Spirit,</hi> the Waſhing of Baptiſm outwardly, and the inward Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Holy Ghoſt are the Principles by which it is effected. (V. 5.) <hi>That,</hi> Could it be compaſſed in that groſs way <hi>Nicodemus</hi> miſapprehended; yet, that would be of no Efficacy, no Advantage at all in this Caſe. For, ſince in all Productions the thing born receives the Nature and Reſemblance of That, whence its Being was deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; Fleſh could only produce Fleſh. But the new Creature, which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, conſiſts in the Mind; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to bring forth a new Spirit, it is neceſſary, that the Vital Principle ſhould be a Spirit. (V. 6.) And, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he might find ſome difficulty in aſſenting to this, becauſe neither the Cauſe, nor the manner of its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fall under the notice of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Senſes, yet is not that any juſt Exception againſt the Reality of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49873:106"/> Fact; A very familiar Inſtance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he alledges in the Words of my Text, which are thus introduced by the <hi>ſeventh</hi> Verſe. <hi>Marvel not that I ſaid unto thee, Ye muſt be born again; The Wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the Sound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Words plainly conſiſt of two parts, <hi>A Similitude,</hi> and <hi>The Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and my Diſcourſe upon them ſhall accordingly diſtribute it ſelf into theſe Two Heads.

                  <item>Firſt, <hi>From the Similitude I ſhall draw ſome general Concluſions, which may direct us in our Contemplation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths, and eſpecially That of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, which is the Subject Matter of our Lord's Argument with</hi> Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, <hi>From the Application I ſhall conſider how far the properties of the Wind mentioned here, will give us any juſt ground to judge of the Holy Spirit's workings upon the Souls of Men.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <pb n="196" facs="tcp:49873:107"/>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>I begin with ſome General Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions drawn from the Similitude it ſelf; ſuch as may direct us in our Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Truths; and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in That of Regeneration, which is the ſubject Matter of our Lord's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with</hi> Nicodemus. And theſe Concluſions are as follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>A man may have ſufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to aſſure himſelf that a Thing really is, without being able to give an account how it came to be.</hi> For the Cauſe of a Thing is indeed one, and a very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory way, of coming to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Knowledge of its Nature. But this is but One way of Many, and Some things, which we cannot come at this way, may be ſo certain to us, that it would be the Extremity of an Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Singularity to deny them. For as things have Cauſes, ſo have they likewiſe Effects, and Properties, and other Characters, by which they may be diſtinguiſhed. And it is enough in all Conſcience, if any of theſe give Evidence of their exiſting. For we are every whit as ſure, that what hath no Being of its own cannot have Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Effects, as we are, that it could never have been without a Cauſe.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49873:107"/> And therefore, when we are able to aſſign any ſuch Properties or Effects, that is a Demonſtration of the Reality of the Thing. For inſtance, Very Few, if Any, of the moſt Learned, have been able to give a ſatisfactory Account of the Original of Winds, but the Hypotheſis of one Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, is diſliked and exploded by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now though theſe Curious Searchers into Nature cannot agree <hi>whence they come and whither they go;</hi> yet herein they all agree, that <hi>come</hi> and <hi>go</hi> they do. This they know without any ſearch; And the unletter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part of the World, who have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Capacity, nor Leiſure, for nice Enquiries, believe it as firmly, and know it as aſſuredly, as They. In like manner, if there be certain Marks, by which a Man <hi>born of the Spirit</hi> is evidently diſcerned, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from another that is not ſo born; We may from thoſe Marks conclude, that ſuch a Man is Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, though we could not poſitively determine from whence this Principle of new Life took its riſe: Or if we knew, as know we may, that it could be owing to no other Cauſe but the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49873:108"/> Operations of the Holy Ghoſt; we may then, where ſuch Marks appear, be confident that the ſanctifying Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Holy Ghoſt have paſſed upon that Perſon, though neither We who were Standers-by, nor perhaps the Man himſelf, was conſcious of the Manner, in which they were begun, and carried on in his mind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>A thing may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently perceivable One way, which is not at all ſo in another.</hi> For in all Objects of Knowledge, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Agreement and Proportion betwixt that Object and the Organ or Faculty that is contrived to apprehend it; and upon this mutual Suitableneſs depends the Perception. Thus it is with our Bodily Senſes; Each of them have parts fitted for receiving ſuch Impreſſions as are proper to their purpoſe; and the Qualities of Bodies are not applied to All theſe parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently; but ſeverally to Each; as Each is by Nature accommodated for the entertaining, and making a Report of them to the Soul. Thus we do not hear Colours, nor ſee Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, nor ſmell Sounds; and yet we are as fully ſatisfied, that there are
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49873:108"/> Sounds, though we hear them only, as if we ſaw and ſmelt them too. To the ſame purpoſe it is, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our argues in the Text. A Man ſees not either any Shape, or any Motion, of the Wind it ſelf; All that he knows of this kind, is only the motion of other Bodies agitated by it; And yet he makes no difficulty to allow, that <hi>it blows, when he hears the ſound of it;</hi> becauſe the Wind is not an Object proportioned to the Eye, but the noiſe of it is to the Ear; and therefore he receives the Teſtimony of that Senſe, which has a Competent Knowledge, without troubling himſelf, that this is not confirmed by the other Senſes, which are incapable of knowing any thing, in the matter. This is the force of the Alluſion, and that which by Parity of Reaſon ariſes from it is this. That the Caſe is the ſame between the Intellectual Faculties and the Senſitive in general, with that betwixt One Senſe and Another. And, if we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a thing's Reality when we hear the Sound, but ſee no Shape of it; becauſe it is in Nature fitted to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our Hearing, but not our Sight; There is the ſame Reaſon, why we
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49873:109"/> ſhould aſſent, to what our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding can apprehend, though our Senſes do not; if it be of that kind, which may give evidence to the mind, and make it ſelf underſtood; though it cannot make it ſelf ſeen, or heard, or felt by us. Now a Spirit cannot work upon the outward Organs, which can never be moved by any other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions than thoſe of Body and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; But if by help of Meditation, by laying and comparing things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conſidering the Conſequences that naturally reſult from them, we find that ſuch a thing there is, and ſuch Footſteps there are of its Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we then may and ought to reſt ſatisfied, both of the Exiſtence, and the Operation of that Spirit. Becauſe we have the Evidence proper for the Condition of the thing; ſuch as it is capable of; And the Intellectual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Mind, were intended by God for Helps and Inſtruments of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Knowledge, no leſs than the Senſitive Organs of the Body. Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Objects require different Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. XII.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath obſerved it, as an Ornament and Excellence, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any Imperfection of Humane
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49873:109"/> Nature, that the ſeveral Parts have their ſeveral Offices allotted to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is implyed by this Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, that <hi>ſome things are capable of being known by the Eſſects, which we cannot come to the Knowledge of any other way.</hi> No man need go far for Proof of This. <hi>Intùs habes quod poſcis.</hi> We all are ſure, that we carry ſomewhat about us which we call a Soul. Somewhat that thinks, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberates, and chuſes, that imagines, and judges, and remembers; that fears, and hopes, and loves, and hates, and deſires, and refuſes, and grieves, and rejoyces, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Apprehenſions we receive, of the Objects about which we are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. This we know from our own Feeling and Experience: And yet the Wiſeſt of us all do not know the time when, or the manner how, this Soul was created, and united to our Bodies, nor a Thouſand Difficulties more, which might be ſtarted; but yet ſtagger not any reaſonable Man's aſſent; becauſe he is ſatisfied, that theſe Effects muſt have a Cauſe adequate to them. So likewiſe Our Saviour takes for granted, that the noiſe and Sound
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49873:110"/> was Proof ſufficient that the Wind blows; the ſhakings and rattlings of Boughs, the raiſing Storms at Sea, the tearing up Trees, and rocking of Houſes, All convince us, that the Air is in a Violent Agitation; and yet we are not privy to the firſt beginnings of it. We cannot tell what raiſed this mighty Ferment, nor where it ſet out, nor how far it intends, nor what becomes of it when it ceaſes. The Mariners are ſure they are carried up to the Heaven, and down again to the deep; they ſee the Waves boil and foam like a Pot, and feel their Veſſel ſtagger like a drunken Man; and they doubt not to conclude the Wind is the doer of it, without ever diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, how it was able to diſturb the face of the Deep, or blow up the Waters into ſuch Rage and Tumult. And it is here urged to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> as a thing equally agreeable to Reaſon, that men ſhould ſubmit to the Belief of a Second Birth, if the Effects of that Birth appear, though the Cauſe and Progreſs of it do not. For inſtance, St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>He</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 John III. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>that doth Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is born of God, in this the Children of God are manifeſt, and the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49873:110"/> Children of the Devil.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us, That <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. V. 6. VI. 15.</note> 
               <hi>the New Creature is Faith which worketh by Love;</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Gal. V. 22.</note> that <hi>the Fruits of the Spirit are Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Faith, Meekneſs, and Temperance:</hi> We are likewiſe told, <note n="‖" place="margin">Phil. II. 13.</note> 
               <hi>That it is God, who worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> Now from hence it follows moſt undeniably, that let Moral Duties be never ſo much diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, as mean and low, and Legal; Yet whereſoever we ſee any Man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Righteouſly; where we find ſuch a mixture of Faith and Charity, and all that bright Conſtellation of Virtues mentioned juſt now; we may and ought to pronounce that Man <hi>born of the Spirit.</hi> For though the Tree be not viſible to us, yet the Fruits are; and ſince thoſe Practices are the Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Product of the Influences of the Spirit, and cannot be produced from any other Principle; to attribute them to Nature, or to any thing beſides, is in effect to ſay, <hi>that Grapes may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of Thorns; and Figs of Thiſtles.</hi> For it is <hi>this good Tree alone that can bring forth thoſe good Fruits.</hi> And if by the Fruits it were not ſufficiently
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49873:111"/> to be known, our Saviour would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have confirmed, nor the Common Senſe of Mankind have agreed, in making Good and Evil Actions, an infallible Character, whereby to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Spirits and Principles from whence they flow.</p>
            <p>And a neceſſary Conſequence of this Particular is, That if ſuch Good Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, where they are conſpicuous, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they are wrought by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that God hath renewed that Man, and did, and does ſtill, act and dwell in him: Then it is no leſs certain, that where the Contrary Vices and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are predominant, thoſe men are not Regenerate, nor does the Spirit of God work in them. <hi>Let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <note n="*" place="margin">1 John III. 10.</note> 
               <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth not righteouſneſs is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Brother.</hi> Men may delude themſelves and their ignorant Followers, with boaſting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; they may have the Impiety even to ſanctify their blackeſt Crimes, by fathering them upon Divine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe and Inſpiration: But, while we ſee them turbulent and factious, proud and diſobedient, cenſorious and bitter, unjuſt and uncharitable, can we think
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49873:111"/> that God is the Author of, or dwells with theſe froward Diſpoſitions? It were a Contradiction to all Religion to ſuppoſe ſo; and, however they may be exalted by their own vain I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, yet alas! <hi>they know not</hi> themſelves, nor <hi>what Spirit they are of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. There is yet a <hi>Fourth</hi> Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion eaſy to be gathered from the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude before us, which is, That <hi>when once we know all that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for our purpoſe, we ought to make the beſt Improvement of that; and not raiſe Miſts, and perplex our Minds, and neglect our Duty, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging unprofitable Enquiries after what we cannot, or need not, know.</hi> The End of all Knowledge, whether Natural or Revealed, is not Curioſity but Uſe; And while we want no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that may be ſerviceable, it is not only Folly, but Impiety, to dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Niceties, and mere Speculations. Let us put the Caſe, that a Pilot, or a Husbandman, were admitted into the dark Caverns of the Earth, and ſaw Vapours there engender into Winds; What Benefit would Humane Life receive from any Intelligence he could bring from thence? Could ſuch a one
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49873:112"/> ſwell his Sails, or make more way with a Convenient Gale? Could he bid the Tempeſts be ſtill, or ſmooth the face of the Deep, for being let in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Secret? Could the Farmer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Fruits from a Blaſt, any more than he can now? The ſame Methods would ſtill obtain in each Profeſſion, and the ſame degrees of Efficacy they would have. Why ſhould it not be ſo in Religion too? The Cauſes when ſeen would be the ſame they are now; Our Knowledge could not add new Force and Vigour, but they muſt act neither more nor leſs than they do unſeen. Could we diſtinctly feel and ſee, and make Reflections upon our Second Birth, this would profit us no more, the want of it can prejudice us no more, than it does in the Natural. The Infant is perfectly in the dark, while he is in the Womb, He knows not what is doing, when the Embryo is formed, and nouriſhed there; He comes to Maturity and ſtruggles for Freedom, and forces his Paſſage into the World, without being ſenſible why, or how, this is done. When he arrives at the uſe of Reaſon, he hath not the leaſt Remembrance of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49873:112"/> this kind; yet Nature keeps her Courſe, and performs her Charge faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and with great Exactneſs, and All he can collect is, that he is born a Man; And This he is infallibly ſure of, becauſe he lives, and moves, and acts as a Man. In like manner the Children of God know they are born of Him, becauſe they govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a Spiritual and Divine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. And this they do, not one whit the leſs, notwithſtanding they cannot enter into the Cauſes and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of this Birth. The Efficient Cauſe they know was the Spirit, and could be none elſe; and the Dignity of His Perſon is the Conſideration, which muſt deterr them from reſiſting his Motions, and doing deſpight to his Grace, and quenching that Life he hath given them. They can ſhow all the Signs of ſuch a Birth; the meek and Dove-like Diſpoſition; the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Heavenly Converſation, which none, but They who are of God, can have. And the Advantages at laſt will be the ſame too. For, as the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman gathers in that Corn, which, though of his own ſowing, comes up he knows not how; ſo they <hi>who ſow
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49873:113"/> to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap life Everlaſting,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Galat. VI. 8.</note> though they underſtand not all the myſterious ways, by which they were enabled to grow in Grace and put forth the precious fruits of righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Well were it if theſe few Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were duly weighed, and diſcreetly obſerved: They would reſtrain that bold and buſy temper, that inſolent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious arguing, which under colour of Reaſon and free Thinking, brings holy Myſteries into Contempt, and ſhipwracks numbers of unwary Souls. Thoſe divine Truths above our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion would then be received with Meekneſs, or at leaſt diſputed with Modeſty; For, though we cannot fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom this Abyſs, yet it comes to us confirmed with proper Teſtimonies, and ſuch as, <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> does by no means confute or weaken. This <hi>Nicodemus</hi> urged to Chriſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Spiritual and Second Birth, and yet our Lord did not allow the Objection. Nay, even this Birth it ſelf hath ſuffered too, and been ill repreſented, by daring Attempts of Men, who have undertaken to ſhew the manner of it, and ſpeak very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively, where God was ſilent. In
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49873:113"/> Oppoſition to whoſe dangerous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, I ſhall now come to my</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Second</hi> Head, and from the <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> will conſider, <hi>how far the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Wind mentioned in this Similitude, will give us any juſt ground to judge of the Holy Spirit's workings upon the minds of men.</hi> The Application is contained in the laſt Clauſe of the Verſe, <hi>So is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> That is; The work of Regeneration carries great Reſemblance to what is obſerved of the Wind; for as There we gather its Blowing, from the Sound and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Effects; though we do not ſee the Blaſt, nor its Riſe and Paſſage, nor are acquainted with the Cauſe that ſets it on: So may a Child of God know he is ſuch, by the Effects and Characters of that Relation; though he do not ſee the Spirit that renews him, though the Operations by which he is renewed be ſuch, as fall not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Obſervation of his outward Senſes, nor is perhaps his own mind conſcious to many things, by which that Change is wrought in him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And <hi>firſt,</hi> From that Expreſſion, <hi>The Wind bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> we
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49873:114"/> may I think, fairly infer the Freedom of God's Grace. That he gives it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally, and of his own accord, and that it is what no Merit of ours can oblige him to give. In this Argument St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath laboured much, <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. XI, IV, IX, Chapters.</note> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the very notion of Grace and the nature of it is contrary to that of Works and of Debt. That <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the Father and the Pattern of the Faithful, received the Call and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, while he was yet among Idolaters, and could have no Works to boaſt of; That, when Jews and Gentiles were both concluded under Sin, God choſe the Gentiles, as he did <hi>Jacob</hi> before <hi>Eſau,</hi> freely while yet in the Womb; Not that the One of theſe had any wrong done him, or was uſed worſe than he deſerved; but the Other found great Favour, and was uſed better than he deſerved; And ſo the Choſen ought to be thankful and rejoyce, but the Rejected could not complain, nor had he any thing to accuſe God of. Thus it is alſo in the Work of Regeneration. God gives us his preventing Graces freely; He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts the Light of his Goſpel, and it is a marvellous Bleſſing to be born and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49873:114"/> educated in thoſe happy Regions, which are enlightned with the pure Luſtre of it. When we believe this Goſpel, it's his Grace that diſpoſes our minds to do ſo; When that Faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts it ſelf in Works of Obedience, This alſo is owing to the Aſſiſtances of his Grace. When we improve to higher excellencies, and approach nearer to the Perfections of a Spiritual and Divine Life, This is again from the more abundant Communications of the ſame Grace. 'Tis true indeed, Chriſt hath engaged to give an increaſe of <hi>Talents to Them</hi> who make a good Uſe of the <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. XXV. 29.</note> Talents they already have; He hath aſſured us, that our <note n="†" place="margin">Luke XI. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father will not fail to grant the holy Spirit to them that ask him:</hi> But ſtill it is by the Aid and Influence of that very Spirit, that we ask the Talents we have not, and that we improve thoſe we have. So that This does but enhance God's Mercy and Bounty ſo much the more, which firſt enables us to act, and then rewards us for acting; For that is in effect to crown and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat His Own Work, rather than Our Deſert; ſince what we do acquires a Title to his Promiſe, and yet it is
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49873:115"/> what we could not do, if He did not impart to us the Power of doing it.</p>
            <p>There is indeed another Senſe of this Expreſſion fixed upon by an <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cajetan.</hi>
               </note> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of Note, which is, that the Spirit of God blows upon mens minds, in ſo gentle a manner, as not to take away the liſtings of them, but leaves the Will the ſame Exerciſe of its Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, though in Conjunction with, and under the Conduct of, Grace. But This, if I miſtake not, though it be deducible from the Text, ſeems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be implied in that other Paſſage, <hi>Thou canſt not tell whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth.</hi> By which I conceive we are led to a</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Second</hi> Reflection concerning the manner of the Spirit's working upon our minds, which is, That, As we can give no account of the Riſe, the increaſe, the quieting of the Wind, where it began, where it will ſtop, or how long it will laſt; So the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit are many times very remote from our Underſtanding. He may move us without our having any diſtinct Perception of the thing; nor can we always ſay, Then the impulſe began, thus long it continued, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49873:115"/> now it ceaſes to move me. And this cannot ſeem very ſtrange to any, that ſhall conſider, by what ſteps he hath come off from a wicked Life, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in a Good one. For in all This he will find nothing of Violence or External Compulſion, but ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives all along as were entirely agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Faculties, and the Methods by which he proceeds in other Caſes. For did not this Change begin with a Conviction of Sin, and the Evil of it, and conſequent hereunto a Hatred and Deteſtation ground upon ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as theſe; that it is contrary to Reaſon, diſpleaſing to God, deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to Soul and Body, in rendring Both obnoxious to the Divine Wrath and Vengeance, and that Eternity of Miſery, which the preſent fleeting Pleaſures of Wickedneſs are a very poor and ſilly Exchange for? Again, Will not his Advance in Vertue be found to owe it ſelf, to the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Beauty, the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Advantages of Holineſs, the Alluring Rewards it propoſes, the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs it ſecures in this Life and the next? How then did Theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prevail at laſt? Was it not by
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49873:116"/> frequent Meditation, by inſinuating themſelves into the Mind by degrees, by the common Methods of Reading, or Hearing, and weighing God's word; by vanquiſhing the prejudices of our corrupt Hearts, by diſcuſſing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing the Evidence of Truth, by faithful and honeſt Application; by exciting good deſires, ſtrengthening thoſe Deſires with Holy Reſolutions, and making good theſe Reſolutions by diligent Endeavours and ſtedfaſt Perſeverance? But ſtill the Finger of God is in all This. It is He, that brings theſe Conſiderations into our hearts at firſt. He, that faſtens them upon us when they are there; He, that adds new Life and Vigour to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Intentions, and gives Efficacy and Succeſs to our, otherwiſe Weak and imperfect, Attempts. He convinces our Judgments, kindles good Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, perſuades, allures, threatens, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrs; terrifies, reproaches; comforts, commends; and performs all other Offices neceſſary to Piety; But theſe he performs <hi>in</hi> us, and <hi>with</hi> us, and <hi>by</hi> us. From Him, as we acknowledge in our daily Prayers, all <hi>holy deſires,</hi> all <hi>good counſels,</hi> and all <hi>juſt works</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49873:116"/> But they proceed from Him in ſuch a manner, as ſtill to be <hi>our</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, <hi>our</hi> counſels, and <hi>our</hi> works. We know we cannot come to <hi>Chriſt exceept the Father draw us,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are ſure, that as many as come are drawn: But then they are drawn by the Cords of a Man; invited and wrought upon by the dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by the Inſtructions and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God's Word, by the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and Checks of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; In a manner ſuitable to their Rational Nature and Faculties, in a way that requires their own Coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Conſent; and the more Men work the more God will work with them. In a word, the Spirit acts in the Nature of an Aſſiſtant againſt our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, but not as an Undertaker of the Work, or a Bearer of the whole Burden; And all he does is by Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo gentle, ſo ſweet, ſo ſecret, ſo tender, as to fall in with our own thoughts. And if Scripture had not declared all the Good we do to be from God, we could not many times diſtinguiſh between the Motions of His Spirit, and thoſe of Our own. That thus it is, both Reaſon, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49873:117"/> and (which is moſt of all) Revelation abundantly inform us. Hence men are ſaid to be <note n="*" place="margin">John XVII. 17. Epheſ. V. 26.</note> 
               <hi>ſanctified by the Word, of God, and by the Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Water,</hi> and to be <note n="‖" place="margin">Rom XV. 16.</note> 
               <hi>ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Why? Becauſe the Spirit of God is the Author and Finiſher, and the Word and Sacraments are the Means and Inſtruments, of our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. <note n="†" place="margin">1 Pet. I. 3.</note> 
               <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to <hi>beget men to a Spiritual Life;</hi> and the <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. IV. 15.</note> Miniſters of the Goſpel are ſaid to <hi>beget</hi> them alſo: And very properly both; for We apply Arguments, and God ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them effectual; Our People at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to thoſe Arguments, and God gives them the power of Perſwaſion, and ſets them home, and fixes them upon their minds, and thus conveys to them a Principle of Spiritual Life, by the Mediation of Our Miniſtry. God promiſes to give Sinners <note n="†" place="margin">Ezek. XVIII. 31.</note> a <hi>new heart,</hi> and be commands Sinners to make themſelves a <note n="‖" place="margin">Ezek. XXXVI. 25.</note> 
               <hi>new heart.</hi> And what can any reaſonable Reader gather from this, but that the Renewing of our Souls is wrought by the Concurrence of Almighty God with our own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours? St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares, himſelf <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. XV. 10.</note> 
               <hi>laboured more abundantly than all the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49873:117"/> Apoſtles;</hi> and yet declares in the ſame Breath, that <hi>it was not He, but the Grace of God, which was with him.</hi> The plain and natural Conſequence whereof is, that the Labour was His, but the Power, and the Glory, and the Succeſs of it, God's. The ſame Apoſtle exhorts the <hi>Philippians,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Phil. II. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>to work out their own Salvation,</hi> becauſe it <hi>is God, that worketh in them both to will, and to do, of his good Pleaſure.</hi> And wherein lies the force and fitneſs of that Motive, except in This? that Something We muſt do, or God will do Nothing; but, that All We can do will ſignify Nothing, except God came in to our Aſſiſtance, and do Something too.</p>
            <p>The Point before us may be farther confirmed by the various Conſtructions of the word <hi>Spirit</hi> in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which is ſometimes oppoſed to the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> ſometimes to the <hi>Letter</hi> and the <hi>Law;</hi> Sometimes it ſignifies the outward Miniſtration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; Sometimes the inward Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Grace in our Hearts. And the beſt Inference I know of from this Ambiguity of Expreſſion, is, that leading a Life of Reaſon, and Purity,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49873:118"/> in Oppoſition to our Brutiſh and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Luſts; living a Life of Faith in Oppoſition to the Law of Ceremonies and Conſidence in our own Works; governing our ſelves by the written Word of God, and obſerving the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and good motions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God within us, mean and come all to the ſame thing at laſt; that He who does the One, does the Other alſo; and <hi>Walking in the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>living after the Spirit,</hi> in clude them all, in which ſoever of theſe Senſes you interpret it. Now theſe are Matters, in which, when we are excited to them, nothing farther is diſcernible by Us, than the Reſolutions and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity of our own minds; but, from comparing theſe Texts, it manifeſtly appears, that God is all the while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Curtain, and works ſtrongly, though he work unſeen.</p>
            <p>And, Methinks, it ought by no means to ſeem an incredible thing, that He, who made our Minds, and ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own Image upon them, ſhould be ſo intimate with theſe Minds of Ours, as to communicate whatever In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſluences he ſees ſit, without being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to make uſe of our Bodily
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49873:118"/> Organs, or any ſuch groſs Means, as muſt fall under the notice of our Senſes. We know, our own Soul moves us, and yet we do not feel it by any Impulſe, that makes a ſenſible Impreſſion upon this outward Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: Nor can we ſay, how this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is conveyed from an Immaterial to the fineſt Corporeal Subſtance: How That commands ſo powerfully, and every part of This obeys ſo readily. Surely then He, who created Soul and Body both, and found a way to move Matter, by that which is not Matter, cannot want Methods of making His Spirit correſpond with Ours (the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit creating with that created by it) no nor of carrying on this Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ſo eaſy and familiar a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that We our ſelves, when blown upon from above, ſhall not be able to diſcern diſtinctly, <hi>whence this Wind cometh, and whither it goeth.</hi> I will juſt mention ſome Inferences which ſeem undeniably to follow from the former Arguments, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And <hi>Firſt,</hi> This ſhews the Error of thoſe men, who require it, as a mark of Grace to aſſign the Inſtant of ones own Converſion. For in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49873:119"/> they ſuppoſe ſeveral things which contradict what hath been delivered, and cannot, as I preſume, ſtand with our Saviour's meaning in the Text. They muſt ſuppoſe, That the work of Converſion was wrought in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; That the manner of effecting it was by ſtrong and ſenſible Impreſſions, ſuch as the Party muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of; That it was a Violent as well as a ſudden Change; And thus they raiſe this Wind up into a Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, that ſhall carry men forcibly from a State of Sin, to a State of Grace: They make it a motion in which men are purely paſſive; for all this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, in the Blowing of ſuch a Wind, as men will not content themſelves with the Sound of, to be ſatisfied of its Truth, but require an account <hi>whence it cometh, and whither it goeth?</hi> And laſtly, they ſtretch this Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor of a Second Birth too far; and make that ſignify the Manner of the Operation, which is only intended to import the Greatneſs of the Change.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What went before deſerves to be well conſidered, becauſe if it were ſo, it would make men very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul not to reſiſt any of the good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49873:119"/> nor go againſt the Senſe and Chidings, of their own Breaſts. <hi>Quenching,</hi> and <hi>Grieving,</hi> and <hi>Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Doing Deſpight to the Spirit of God,</hi> are what moſt People ſeem to have a great Dread and Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of; but the misfortune is, that they often commit theſe Crimes, without being aware that they do ſo. Should God in a Clap of Thunder, bid the Sinner hold his hand, it is probable the ſturdieſt of them all would not dare to proceed in a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Act; Should he ſtrike every man to the Ground with ſuch a dazzling Light as he did St. <hi>Paul,</hi> They would (it is to be hoped) preſently ask with Him, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have one to do?</hi> But as it is, They ſee no viſible Tokens of the Divinity, and therefore they regard not his Calls. Now God by the Manifeſtation of himſelf to <hi>Elijah,</hi> ſhewed that <hi>He was in the Still ſmall voice,</hi> though not in the ſtrong <hi>Wind nor the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,</hi> nor <hi>the Fire.</hi> And if his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit mingle it ſelf with our Thoughts, If (as hath been ſaid) it act upon us by the outward Miniſtry of the Word, by the inward Dictates and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49873:120"/> Reaſonings of our minds; If the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects only of his working be viſible, but the Manner of it imperceptible; Then every Admonition from the Pulpit, Every wholſome Law, Every Advice from a Friend or a Parent, Every good Book, Every pious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Every Motion and Intention to do well, Every Conviction or Check of our own Conſcience, is a <hi>Blowing of this Wind,</hi> a Call, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe from above; And as often as any Man refuſes to comply with theſe things, ſo often he reſiſts God, and quenches his Spirit within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This ſhews us, what Courſe men ſhould take, in order to get, or to grow in Grace; For ſince God works by and with his Ordinances; our Buſineſs muſt be to uſe the Word and Sacraments, and other means of Grace diligently; to ſeek him there, to put to the Shoulder, and do Our Part reſolutely and manfully, and then not doubt his Aſſiſtance. For upon theſe Terms, we may depend upon it, that He will forward and ſtrengthen our good Intentions; and (ſince he creates all our Works in us,)
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49873:120"/> that he will not fail to finiſh what he himſelf hath begun, but will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and continue it until the Day of Chriſt Jeſus; and in that day for his Sake and Merits, will moſt aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crown Us and our Labours with Everlaſting Glory.</p>

            <p>THE Evangeliſt, after having in the beginning of the Chapter, with great Exactneſs, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Eternal Divinity of the Word
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49873:121"/> of God, and, that This was the very Perſon teſtified of by the Baptiſt, (by which we are aſſured, that this Word, is no other than Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God incarnate;) and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving likewiſe ſpoken of his coming into the World, he mentions here with what different ſucceſs he did it. Some, that were more peculiarly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged, and moſt nearly related to him, from whom an honourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception might moſt reaſonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, gave him no Reſpect, no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment at all.

            <p n="1">I. The <hi>Firſt</hi> thing, we are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know upon this occaſion, is, Who thoſe Perſons are to whom the Advantages of Chriſtianity belong, or What that Condition is which muſt qualify men for the Benefits of Chriſt's coming into the World; This the Text hath expreſſed in thoſe words, who <hi>receive him,</hi> and <hi>believe on his Name.</hi> Now theſe are Terms expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory of one another; And, as the <hi>Jews</hi> are therefore ſaid not to have <hi>received him,</hi> becauſe they <hi>believed him not,</hi> but rejected his Authority and Doctrine: So Faith in what he hath revealed, and Obedience to what he hath commanded, are the Marks and Means of our receiving him. And Theſe conſiſt, not in a mere giving him the hearing, and forbearing all publick and malicious Oppoſition to his word; but in acknowledging the Truth and the Evidence of it; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon his Promiſes, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation from that Name and no other, and diligently endeavouring to perform all that is required on our part; All, that, according to the Covenant of the Goſpel, can any way contribute to the rendring what he
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49873:123"/> hath done and ſuffered effectual in our own particular Caſe.</p>
            <p>That This muſt needs be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Phraſe is manifeſt to any man who will conſider it cloſely. For <hi>to receive</hi> Chriſt is to receive him as he is, to ſubmit to him in all thoſe Capacities, which God hath placed him over us in. To receive him as our <hi>Prophet</hi> implies a firm Adherence to the whole of that Meſſage, which he hath brought us from Heaven, to own his Divine Commiſſion, and be inſtructed by him. To receive him as our <hi>Prieſt,</hi> is to rely upon his moſt meritorious Sacrifice, to confeſs the Sufficiency of his Atonement, and to deteſt and forſake thoſe Sins, for which he hath made ſo perfect, but withal ſo ſevere and painful, an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation. To receive him as our <hi>King,</hi> is to own his Legiſlative Power, to pay him ſtrict Fidelity and Allegiance, to bring all our Paſſions and Intereſts under Subjection to his Will, and ſuffer no rebellious Appetites to raiſe wicked Seditions, or tempt us to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs and Diſloyalty againſt him.</p>
            <pb n="229" facs="tcp:49873:123"/>
            <p>The ſame is likewiſe neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent upon <hi>Believing;</hi> For, ſince the Object of all Faith is Credible Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, and that of Religious Faith is Divine Revelation, He, who acts, or entertains Perſuaſions contrary to, or derogating from, what God hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Chriſt, cannot properly be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Believer on his Name. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath made ſomething elſe neceſſary, beſides a bare Aſſent of the mind to the Truth of his Doctrines; All That muſt needs come within the compaſs, and be included under the notion, of Faith. If the Evangeliſt tell us in one place, as he does here particularly, that by <hi>believing</hi> men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Privilege of becoming <hi>Sons of God,</hi> and <hi>are born of God;</hi> and yet our Saviour ſays poſitively in another (as in the Third of this Goſpel at the fifth Verſe, we find he does) that <hi>Except a man be born again of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> it is very plain, that this Belief muſt be ſuch as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with, and evidenced by a ſolemn entring into Covenant with God by Baptiſm. And He who reſts upon a naked Belief, and will not be
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49873:124"/> baptized when he may, expects in vain, that God will reckon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Children, or admit him to any part of his Inheritance; after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo peremptorily declared, that ſuch a one is none of his, nor in any Condition of entring into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And ſo in general, If, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the truth of the Scriptures, and confeſſing the Sufferings, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Exaltation of Chriſt; In a word, If to the moſt Orthodox Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that ever were or can be, we are commanded by the Word of God to add the reverent Obſervation of Divine Ordinances, devout Prayer, frequent receivings of the Sacrament, and all manner of Vertue and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of Life; He who neglects Theſe, and puts Confidence in his Underſtanding or Owning the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion, builds upon a ſandy and deceitful bottom; His hope is that of Hypocrites, and will at laſt loſe both it ſelf and Him that che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes it.</p>
            <p>And the Reaſon of theſe things is very obvious. For the Redemption of the World by Chriſt is an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Act in God, an Act of Free
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:49873:124"/> Mercy: As ſuch, it is what no Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of Natural Light, or Moral Juſtice can give us any Apprehenſion at all of. Conſequently we can enter no farther into the grounds, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, than He who did it of his own accord thinks fit to let us into. Conſequently again, we are bound to take the Manifeſtations of it entire, Not to parcel them out, as we ſee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and ſo make One Clauſe of this Indenture repugnant to and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of Another. No reaſonings of our own are of any weight in this Caſe, any further than they are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Revelation, by the natural Senſe of ſome Text of Scripture, and by the general deſign of the Chriſtian Diſpenſation. Now the very ſame Spirit which ſays, <note n="*" place="margin">Epheſ. II. 8.</note> 
               <hi>We are ſaved by Grace through Faith,</hi> hath informed us by the Miniſtry of the ſelf-ſame Pen, that <note n="†" place="margin">Galat. V. 6.</note> 
               <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion availeth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, but faith which worketh by Love.</hi> He hath commanded us to <note n="‖" place="margin">Heb. XII. 14.</note> 
               <hi>follow peace with all men, and holineſs,</hi> as things, <hi>without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> He hath drawn a black Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of the Works of the Fleſh,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49873:125"/> and moſt ſolemnly aſſured us, that <hi>they who are guilty of</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Galat. V. 19, 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>Adultery, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Laſciviouſneſs, Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Hereſies, Envyings, Murders, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, Revellings, and ſuch like, ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not now as clear as the Sun, that the Man who truſts to any Faith, except ſuch a Faith, as <hi>worketh by Love,</hi> leans upon a broken Reed? Hath any man reaſon to think his Confeſſing Chriſt will ſave him, who takes no care of either <hi>Peace</hi> or <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and allows himſelf in thoſe Abominations juſt now mentioned? Can he be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Believer, who diſhonours his Profeſſion by a ſcandalous Life? or eſteemed a Son of God, who cannot ſee his face, nor inherit his Kingdom? It were moſt abſurd to think, moſt blaſphemous to ſay ſo. The receiving Chriſt is much another thing than theſe men make it. I have already ſaid, It is not One ſimple Act of the Will, or the Underſtanding; but a large and a permanent thing, an embracing his Doctrines in their juſt extent, and ſubmitting to all the Conſequences of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49873:125"/> them in our Converſations. 'Tis to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Harmony and punctual Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the ſeveral parts of them; that Faith and Virtue, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Precepts, may go hand in hand, and not be ſet in array to ſight againſt and deſtroy each other. And thus it muſt needs be. For He that is otherwiſe perſwaded, acts contrary to this Rule, builds without a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, he forms a New Goſpel of his own, and does not <hi>Believe</hi> but <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume.</hi> In ſhort, God cannot away with theſe partial Proceedings, theſe conſultings with Fleſh and Blood; He will not have his own Inſtitution, the nobleſt and moſt compleat that ever was, to be mangled and defaced; And thoſe very <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſhut Chriſt out, and would not receive him at all, are not more wicked and inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, than the pretended Chriſtians, who receive him by halves, and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cover of this Profeſſion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, and deform, and diſhonour him and his Goſpel. Far be it from us to imagine, that God will ſo far proſtitute his mercies, as to admit ſuch wretches to the incomparable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage mentioned in my Text; They
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:49873:126"/> may uſurp a Title that is not theirs, but the Obedient and Virtuous <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> the Pious and the Reſpectful <hi>Receivers</hi> of Chriſt, Theſe alone are the Perſons who <hi>receive</hi> him as Chriſt, and to them only he <hi>gives power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God.</hi> Which is the Beneſit mentioned in the Words, and the Second Head of my Diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thoſe who have Criticized nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon this Paſſage, make great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon the Evangeliſt's cautious manner of expreſſing himſelf in it. They tell us, It would have been leſs proper to have ſaid, that Chriſt made us become the Sons of God, becauſe this would have ſeemed an Act of Omnipotence and Neceſſity, ſuch as might have been interpreted in preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Freedom of our Will, and that part which we our ſelves contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to our own Regeneration. Nor had it been equally prudent to ſay, that he gave us power to make our ſelves the Sons of God, becauſe this had exalted our Faculties as much too high, and depreſt the Bounty of God, and the Honour he hath done us, as if any Performances of Ours could
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49873:126"/> deſerve or procure this Sonſhip. But by ſaying, he gave us <hi>power to become the Sons of God,</hi> both theſe Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, they think, are ſaved. The Mercy is ſtill repreſented in it's due proportion, in that this Honourable Relation is a Grace, and our Advances toward it not a Meritorious Cauſe, but a Qualification only. And the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of our Actions is ſtill implyed, in that he gave us only a power of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, what yet we might not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if we refuſed, or neglected to exert that power.</p>
            <p>Without being ſo Curious, we may content our ſelves with that Senſe of the word, which our Marginal Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuggeſts, and by <hi>power</hi> underſtand the <hi>Privilege</hi> of becoming the Sons of God, and even thus it affords us theſe two Conſiderations. <hi>The Excellence and Greatneſs of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,</hi> and Then the <hi>Free Beſtowing it upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Excellence and Greatneſs of the Benefit</hi> is abundantly declared in the very Title it ſelf, inſomuch that St. <hi>John</hi> thought he had reaſon to cry out with ſome Aſtoniſhment, when he reflected upon the Excellence
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49873:127"/> of the Benefit, and the unparallel'd Greatneſs of the Condeſcenſion. <note n="*" place="margin">1 John III. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> (ſays he) <hi>what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed on us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God!</hi> And reaſon good he had moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly. For, What could expreſs, What can confer greater Happineſs? By This we are allowed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe our ſelves all that Protection and Tender Care, all that Compaſſion and kind Concern, all that Indulgence and favourable Allowance for our failings, all that ready Relief in our neceſſities, all that ample Proviſion for our proſperity and well being, which Nature inſpires affectionate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with, and gives dutiful Children a right to expect. How much this is I pretend not to deſcribe, for Words cannot do it. I refer my ſelf to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, for Parents only know, and what they know in this reſpect, is much eaſier felt than expreſt. But give me leave to ſay, that, when the beſt good-natured man hath ſummoned all the ſofteſt Reſentments together, that either the Bowels of a Father, or the moſt winning Endearments of a Child, can engage him to. This and much
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49873:127"/> more is derived down upon every Chriſtian, by being the <hi>Son of God. Of God;</hi> whoſe Love is infinite and incomprehenſible, grounded upon better and more ſubſtantial Motives; Who, as he is not moved by the ſame ſprings of Paſſion with mortal Men, ſo he is not ſubject to their Inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Picques, and unaccountable Diſguſts. His Affection is ſteady and permanent; He always loves when we deſerve it, and always pities, and is eaſy to be reconciled, when we do not. <hi>Of God,</hi> whoſe Power is as immenſe as his Love; So that This does not ſpend it ſelf in ſad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and melancholy Reflections, and unprofitable Wiſhes, as that of Earthly Parents often does, who ſee with aking and with bleeding hearts their Children's wants, and even die under thoſe Miſeries they cannot help: But This Father underſtands all our occaſions, can ſupply all our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, can redreſs all our wrongs, remove all our misfortunes, and is not more willing, than he is able to aſſiſt us. Of God I ſay, whoſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not like what we are ſo immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately ſollicitous to procure for our
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49873:128"/> Children here upon Earth; The Prey of uſurping Greatneſs, or treacherous Falſhood, or crafty Forgery; the Booty of Invaſion, and Violence, and Theft; the Sport of Fire, and Water, and Winds, and every Element; Nay even the Food of Ruſt, and Moths, Or, if ſpared by all theſe, yet at the beſt ſuch as muſt waſt, and periſh in the uſing; But an Inheritance, large and Eternal as the Bounteous Giver, above the reach of Caſualties, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting even Time it ſelf. <hi>Of God</hi> laſtly, the King of Kings and Lord of all Lords, One who exalts us to a Dignity infinitely above what any Earthly Prince or Potentate can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to; The place of Honour in the Court of Heaven, and, without the melancholy Ceremonies of Death and Succeſſion, gives to each Son a Crown; A Crown of Life, a Crown of Glory, a Crown of Righteouſneſs, incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, and that fadeth not away for ever. Theſe are but faint and feeble Repreſentations of the Honours and Happineſſes, that accrue to us by being thus related; But Who can hear even Theſe, without breaking out again into St. <hi>John</hi>'s rapturous Reflection,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49873:128"/> 
               <hi>Behold, what manner of Love the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath beſtowed on us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But I obſerved, <hi>(Secondly,)</hi> that This manner of the Evangeliſt's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing himſelf, as it ſpoke the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo did it alſo imply <hi>the Freedom of the Gift.</hi> The very Nature of a Privilege ſeems to carry ſomething of Indulgence and Grace in it; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which, though granted upon good Conſiderations, yet could not in ſtrict right have been challenged. And This is the Caſe of Chriſtians; They were in no Condition of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting this mighty Favour. Much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe indeed; Their Circumſtances were poor, and low, and miſerable. For what can poſſibly be more ſo, than Man corrupted by Sin? A moſt loſt, moſt polluted Object, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, the Slave, the Child of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; bewildred in Darkneſs and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, captivated and bound up in Chains of Sin and Folly; and paſt the extent of any natural Powers to enlighten, or to releaſe him. Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence only could do it, nay even Omnipotence without Love had not done it to Perfection. But by a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49873:129"/> Conjunction of theſe Two, we are ſet free; Set free the nobleſt way, not ſo much as the <hi>Spirit of bondage</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> remaining, but are ſo made the Servants, as at the ſame time to attain the <hi>glorious Liberty of the Sons,</hi> of God. Not ſuch by Nature, 'tis true; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted for the ſake of Him who is ſo by Nature, and who in wonderful Condeſcenſion is not aſhamed to call us Brethren.</p>
            <p>My Former Particular took notice, that Some things are required of Us, in order to make good this Adoption. But Theſe are appointed only as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, as Signs, and Seals, and do not ſo much paſs, as record and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, the Act, and inſure the Benefit of it to us. As the Writing of Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does not convey an Eſtate, for the Perſon's Sealing and Delivering does that, but is only called a Deed, becauſe it teſtifies the Deed of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and, as ſuch Teſtimony, ſecures the Poſſeſſion to him for whoſe uſe it was done: So The Sacraments of the Goſpel, when received with Faith and all neceſſary Qualifications, are only the Means, and Methods of deriving this Sonſhip upon us. Seals and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:49873:129"/> of what God does there. But ſtill it is not the Sacrament, but God in and by the Sacrament, that makes us Children. There is no ſuch Merit in the Virtues and Diſpoſitions of the Mind that partakes of them; No ſuch inherent Power in the Matter or the Form, the Words or the Elements, as can by any Efficacy of their own work this mighty Change: All is the Act, the free Gift, the peculiar Bleſſing of the moſt High, exalting theſe things into Effects Myſterious, and above their natural faculties. And, as the Water, though of all Elements moſt fruitful, had produced nothing in the firſt Creation, if the Spirit of God had not brooded upon it; ſo in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Birth it is that Spirit alone that <hi>ſanctifies water to the waſhing away of Sin,</hi> and enables it to bring forth a Child of God. But though ſuch Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes as theſe are of great uſe, to give us ſome Apprehenſion of things that fall not directly under Senſes, yet we are not to ſuppoſe this ſhould hold in every Circumſtance. For between This, and Common Births there is a wide difference, as St. <hi>John</hi> plainly declares, and it is the deſign of my
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49873:130"/> 
               <hi>Third</hi> Particular to obſerve, which takes notice</p>
            <p n="3">III. Of The Manner how this Sonſhip is conferred; from thoſe Words, of my Text, <hi>Who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof ſeems in ſhort to be thus much. That we are not conceive of This, as of Uſual and Natural Births, as if it were produced out of Material Principles, or promoted by Senſual Inclinations; but All here is Spiritual and Sublime; <hi>It is God that beget us of his own will,</hi> and this is done by <hi>the word of truth,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> obſerves, (<hi>Ch.</hi> I. <hi>v.</hi> 18.) Or if you pleaſe to take theſe Expreſſions, as Some have done, in a Metaphorical Senſe, ſo they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that no Faculties of our own, no Deſires of Senſe, no Principles of Reaſon and Morality can riſe ſo high, there muſt be Divine Grace, or there can be no Child of God. The thing is true in both Interpretations, and all the Enlargement I ſhall make upon it, is only to ſet before you the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of this being repreſented to us under the notion of Regeneration or a Second Birth; and then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49873:130"/> the Manner of it's being brought about, as the Scripture hath inſtructed us in it.</p>
            <p>By Natural Birth and Generation it is plain, we come to have a Life, which we had not before. We have a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Motion imparted to us, and from dead ſenſeleſs Matter are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to perform all the Functions that are proper to Humane Nature; Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creature is produced, of the ſame kind with thoſe from whence it ſprung, and grows up by degrees to the ſame uſe of Senſe, the ſame Reaſon, the ſame Underſtanding, the ſame Deſires of what is not convenient, and the ſame Averſions and Fears of what is hurtful and deſtructive to it. And in all theſe Circumſtances men are very properly ſaid to be <hi>born again,</hi> upon their Converſion to, and believing in, Chriſt. The Condition they were in before, is a State of utter Inactivity, and for this reaſon we find them ſtyled <note n="*" place="margin">Epheſ. II. 1.</note> 
               <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> and ſaid to be <hi>quickned</hi> by the Grace and Spirit of God. They were impriſoned and confined, and the utmoſt Efforts they were capable of making, are but like the faint Struggles of an Embryo
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49873:131"/> in the Womb. But this coming to the Birth gives them liberty to exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and lets them into a new and different Scene of Action. It produces a <hi>New Creature,</hi> as the Scripture terms it, that is; Such a Newneſs as a Soul is capable of; New Notions and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and, conſequent to theſe, a New Converſation proceeding from them. So that every ſuch Perſon is quite another Man from what he was before. And this Alteration conforms us to the Image of him that begot us; Every thing is pure and Godlike, and expreſſes a Reſemblance to his Eſſential Holineſs. It gives a freſh turn to our Thoughts and Affections, ſo that we are not acted as before, by the ſame carnal Apprehenſions, nor the ſame ſenſual Inclinations. It imprints a new Character upon our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and gives us a true Senſe of Good and Evil, and it puts a quite different Bent upon our Will; ſuch as diſpoſes us to love what is truly Good, and Spiritual, and Heavenly, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and deteſt what is Worldly, and Wicked. This is that Likeneſs of <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> which juſtifies the Metaphor; The greateſt that can poſſibly happen to a
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:49873:131"/> Soul, the greateſt that a Moral Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is capable of; and ſo great, as to render it very ſignificant and proper to ſay of every ſuch Perſon, that he is <hi>born again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we know, that, by being born, men become part of a Family, and have a Right to a Child's Share in the Diviſion of the Eſtate. And This is another good Reaſon, for mens being ſaid to be <hi>born of God;</hi> becauſe by that means they are let into New Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and acquire New Titles. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells Chriſtians, <hi>that</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. IV.</note> 
               <hi>they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit of Adoption,</hi> and by it have a right to <hi>call God Father,</hi> that they are <hi>Sons,</hi> and <hi>not only Sons, but heirs, heirs of God, and coheirs with Chriſt.</hi> That they are from thenceforth allied to the whole <hi>Family, that is named of God both in Heaven and Earth;</hi> And, from Aliens, and Strangers, and Enemies, come, not only to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a ſtrict Alliance with, but to obtain the moſt honourable, and moſt advantagious. Poſt in, the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold. And ſince theſe Prerogatives among Men are the Effect of Birth and Blood, the ſame conferred with regard to our Spiritual Kindred, and Divine
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49873:132"/> Inheritance, is very fitly repreſented by being <hi>born of God.</hi> For, as Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, though the deareſt Friends, are not legally qualified for them in Settlements of this World, except in default of Iſſue, and where the Race is extinct; So here, none who is not of the Family can inherit, and they who are moſt worthy of it, are firſt made capable of it, by becoming Children. And for this reaſon it is, that this Title is ſo often made uſe of, and ſo highly extolled in Scripture; becauſe, whatever Privileges the Reſt may imply, yet None can miniſter that Comfort and Confidence, None can aſſure our Inheritance, or give us A Pretence to the Glory and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, but this of <hi>Sons</hi> only.</p>
            <p>Now for the Manner of working this Change in us, (which was the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſideration propounded under this Head) That alſo carries ſo great a Similitude to a natural Birth, that no Figure in the World could give us a clearer Idea of the thing. The Act of Generation and Birth gives Being once for all, and, at the inſtant of coming into the World, the Child, the Heir
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49873:132"/> is born, to all the Rights of his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Family. So likewiſe in the Sacrament of Baptiſm, we have the Spirit of God conferred upon us, which, as it is a Spirit of Grace, is a Principle of new Life to us; and, as it is a Spirit of Adoption, it inſtates us in all the Privileges that can belong to Children of ſuch a Father. And for this reaſon our Church, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Covenant is ſtruck, gives thanks to Almighty God, and acknowledges him <hi>a moſt merciful Father, for that it hath pleaſed him to regenerate the</hi> Perſons then newly bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>with his holy Spirit, to receive them for his own Children by Adoption, and to incorporate them into his holy Church:</hi> As alſo ſhe moſt wiſely and truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, at the beginning of her excellent Catechiſm, that in Baptiſm <hi>we are made Members of Chriſt, Children of God, and Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> But a Member muſt be cut off, if it be mortified; Children may provoke their Parents to put them by their Birth-right; and an Heir under Age, is ſuch in Reverſion, and Hope only. The Natural Parent gives a Principle of Life, but it is ſuch a one as will
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:49873:133"/> ſoon periſh and go out again, if due care be not taken to preſerve it. And ſo it is here: The Spirit of God quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens us upon his firſt Infuſions, but we are to cheriſh the kindly warmth. God is our Father in the ſuſtaining and nouriſhing, as well as in the Enlive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning part. He knows, the Life that is in us, is ſubject to perpetual decays, and therefore the ſame natural Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that occaſioned our being born His, does likewiſe engage and aſſure us of all neceſſary Supplies to continue His; provided we uſe what he gives, and employ that Principle of Spiritual Self-preſervation. Grace therefore, though it be given at firſt, yet is not given all at firſt. There is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion given, which makes us Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but we are commanded <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. II. 2.</note> 
               <hi>to feed upon the ſincere milk of the word,</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to <note n="†" place="margin">2 Pet. III. 18. Epheſ. IV. 13.</note> 
               <hi>grow in grace,</hi> and to pray for the increaſe of Grace, that <hi>we may come to the fullneſs of the Stature of perfect men in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> A Man may languiſh under long Indiſpoſitions, and be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with very violent and acute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and yet recover again. And ſo he may commit ſome very foul and grievous Sins, or accuſtom himſelf to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:49873:133"/> the habits of Others that are leſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing to live ſpiritually. Theſe indeed dim the Candle of the Lord, and eclipſe the Brightneſs of its ſhine, but they do not put it abſolutely out. And therefore God, who knows our waſtings and our failings, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his Grace to us, upon the uſe of proper means. Such as Repentance, and Conſideration, the Hearing his Word, and receiving the Sacrament of his Death. Theſe are Spiritual Food and Suſtenance; Theſe are our Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Reſtoratives, ordained to make thoſe that are ſick well, and thoſe that are well, better and ſtronger ſtill. So that there is a mighty difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Regeneration and Renovation. We can be born but once, becauſe we can live but once; and therefore Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which gives Life, cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. But we can recover often, and grow and be nouriſhed often, becauſe we may ſink and droop often, and therefore the Lord's Supper, and other Holy Ordinances, ſhould be frequented often, becauſe they are our Medicines, and our Meats, and our Refreſhments; And accordingly you ſee one of our
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:49873:134"/> Collects <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Collect for</hi> Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Day.</note> begs of God, <hi>that we being regenerate, and made his Children by Adoption and Grace, may daily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by his holy Spirit.</hi> So mighty an Affinity is there between our Natural and Spiritual Condition; So truly we are ſaid to be <hi>born of God,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the New Production and New Principle, and New Relations that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this Life, but alſo from the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of giving it, and of ſuſtaining it, after it is once given.</p>
            <p>I have only time for one word upon my Fourth and laſt Head, the Extent of this Benefit, in thoſe words, <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God.</hi> And what a Comfortable Reflection is this! That there is no diſtinction of Birth, or Quality, of Sex, Age, or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the World! That They who cannot get Admittance ſo much as into the Preſence or Palace of Earthly Princes, ſhould be capable of Thrones and Crowns with the Great Lord of Heaven and Earth! That there is no reſpect of Perſons here! Nothing but Faith and Virtue makes the difference. The Privileges are ſuſpended upon
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49873:134"/> Terms put into our own Power, and never denied, never taken away, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon ſome perſonal and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Default. But of This I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak at large in my next Diſcourſe.</p>

            <p>THeſe Words are the Moral, as it were, of the Fable, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that Similitude, which went before. For our Saviour, who had to deal with a moſt perverſe Generation of Men, found great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to exerciſe his Divine Wiſdom,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49873:135"/> in chuſing, not only the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, but the ſofteſt and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive, methods of Diſcourſe. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Theſe, as well as ſome Other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, he is very reaſonably preſumed to have delivered himſelf ſo often in Parables. But, becauſe they were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative and ſomewhat dark, therefore he frequently cloſes them with ſome very Significant Sentence, which does not only reſult from, but helps to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Compariſon; and is at once the Conſequence and the Key of what had gone before. Of this nature is my Text, and what Relation it bears to the Parable, from the beginning of the Chapter to this Verſe, I ſhall ſhew you as plainly, and as briefly as I can.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> here, and in many other places, is meant the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Goſpel. So called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Doctrine of it both deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Thence to Us, and is deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring us Thither; As alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe This is that peculiar Province, which God hath choſen to exert his glorious Attributes in; his Juſtice, and Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, and Power, and Truth; All which are moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly ſeen in the Preſent State of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49873:136"/> Affairs, which is uſually called the <hi>Kingdom of Grace</hi> here; and ſhall be manifeſted to all the World in their utmoſt Perfection, in the <hi>Kingdom of Glory</hi> hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now, of the ſeveral Steps taken to bring men into this Kingdom, not Any one ſeemed more aſtoniſhing and unaccountable to the World, than That, by which the <hi>Jews,</hi> God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and peculiar People, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and poſtponed; and Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence given to the Idolatrous Gentiles, who knew not the true God, nor had hitherto been acknowledged of him. And therefore This ſurpriſing diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is what our Saviour, by many of his Actions and Miracles, hints would be done; and, by moſt of his Parables, did not only foretell, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how, and why it was done: Of thoſe Declarations there is not Any more full and clear, than this concluded by my Text. Which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with the whole Proceſs and Myſtery of the Goſpel in little; And, from its firſt being planted among men, carries our Eyes to a vaſt and diſtant Proſpect, even the final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Conſummation of all things.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:49873:136"/> For in that general Deſign of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage All I think are agreed; however they diſſent from each other, as to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and leſs material Circumſtances. In which differences I ſhall not at all concern my ſelf at preſent, but give you a ſhort Draught of the Whole, according to what I apprehend to be the moſt natural and reaſonable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of it.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>King</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Verſ. 1.</note> here, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand God the Father, and the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage he made for his Son,</hi> is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Goſpel, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Mankind. This was begun, when he firſt took upon him humane Nature, and joyned his Divinity to our Fleſh; And, continued ſince, in all the Acts of Love and Condeſcenſion, and kind Approaches to his Spouſe the Church, till that joyful Supper of the Lamb, when ſhe ſhall be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fullneſs of her Lord's Joy; and all her true Members, who are now in the Quality of Gueſts only, be from thenceforth inſeparably united to him.</p>
            <p>To this Marriage <note n="†" place="margin">Verſ. 3.</note> ſome were <hi>bidden</hi> before-hand, that is, The <hi>Jews</hi> by the Shadows of a Typical Law, by the Revelations and Writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49873:137"/> had notice of a Redemption and Meſſiah to appear. And to Theſe, when the time of the Wedding was come <hi>(i. e.)</hi> when God was manifeſted in the Fleſh, the King <hi>ſent forth his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, John</hi> Baptiſt, the Diſciples, and our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf, who by his preaching took this Office of invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Company upon him; But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had the former Bidding prepared, nor could the preſent Invitation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon, them to come. <note n="*" place="margin">Verſ. 4.</note> After this, Others are ſent to let them know, that <hi>all things were now ready,</hi> the Proviſion brought in, and nothing but Gueſts wanting. That is, The Apoſtles, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Saviour's Death, made the <hi>Jews</hi> freſh and more preſſing tenders of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; They acquainted them that <hi>the Oxen and Fatlings were killed,</hi> that is, the Son of God was crucified, the true Paſchal Lamb was ſlain, and the Feaſt waited for them; So that now the Maſter of the Entertainment had done His part, and only waited for Their Acceptance, and Appearance. But neither was This Meſſage any more ſucceſsful than the former. Some <note n="†" place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> thought Scorn of the Proffer, as not worth their hearkening to; Some
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49873:137"/> again, had engaged themſelves in Affairs of another kind, and would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Worldly buſineſs to give way, or allow them leiſure for this Spiritual Entertainment: And a Third ſort, <note n="*" place="margin">Verſ. 6.</note> yet worſe than both theſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thoſe gracious Meſſages with Rage and Spight, flew upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that brought them, and with a Malice as unreaſonable, as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable, abuſed, and tormented, and murdered them. This was an Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſo great, an Obſtinacy ſo affected and invincible, that the King was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked beyond all <note n="†" place="margin">Verſ. 7.</note> Patience, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take Vengeance on theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient and bloody men; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> God gave up the <hi>Jews</hi> to utter Exciſion for their Perverſeneſs, and Perſecutions; He iſſued out his Commiſſion to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by Them did not only ſlay thoſe murderous Wretches, but delivered up their City and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to irretrievable Deſtruction. But, after he had done himſelf and his Honour Juſtice upon theſe baſe, theſe bold Contemners of his Majeſty, and his Mercy; it was not fit, that all his bountiful Preparations ſhould be defeated and loſt; And therefore <note n="‖" place="margin">Verſ. 8, 9.</note> the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49873:138"/> Servants are diſmiſt once more, with Orders to pick up all the Stragglers, and Poor, for ſuch in effect were the vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond Gentiles. Theſe received eagerly, what the Former refuſed with diſdain, and <note n="*" place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> a vaſt promiſcuous number came in, ſo as to fill the Table, and anſwer the largeneſs of the Proviſion.</p>
            <p>Thus far the Purport of ſeveral other Parables reaches; but This carries the Matter on yet farther: And ſhews, that the bare Coming in, and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Invitation is not ſufficient, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Dignity of the Perſon, and of the Feaſt be conſulted, and Men come, as ſo ſolemn an Entertainment requires. And therefore <note n="†" place="margin">Verſ. 11, 12.</note> by the <hi>King</hi>'s coming <hi>in to take an account of the Gueſts,</hi> and puniſhing the Man that wanted a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garment, is repreſented, that ſtrict and particular, Examination, which ſhall paſs upon every Chriſtian at the laſt Day: That Then, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the ſame Faith, being Members of the ſame viſible Church, receiving the ſame Sacraments, and enjoying the ſame Privileges, will profit Men no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if their Souls in the mean while be either foul or naked, ſtained with Evil Works, or not adorned with
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:49873:138"/> good ones; That, however Some may paſs upon their Brethren, and not be diſtinguiſht in a Crowd of Believers; yet there will come a time of ſtricter ſearch, and they muſt be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a more diſcerning Eye; One that will [ſeparate, not only between In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and Believers, thoſe that <hi>come,</hi> and thoſe that <hi>refuſe;</hi> but, even of them that do come, between the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and real Good Men. And, though but One ſuch be mentioned here, yet that One is the common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of all diſorderly and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, of all diſſembling and formal Livers, the Type of Their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of Their Doom. Upon the whole of which Matter, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſals of them who would not come, and the Neglect and Miſcarriage of Him that did come, but came not duly qualified, our Bleſſed Lord paſſes this Reflection in the words now read, that <hi>Many are called but few are choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that any Man, who conſiders at all the Circumſtances of this Caſe, may very eaſily reſolve himſelf, who in this Parable are the <hi>Called,</hi> and who the <hi>Choſen</hi> of God. All, to whom his Servants
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:49873:139"/> are ſent, whether they receive his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations or no; And All, who do receive them, though the gracious End of thoſe Meſſages be not fully attained; All, that are bidden and do not come, and all that come, and are thruſt out again for not coming as they ought; Theſe are the <hi>Called,</hi> and theſe are <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> But thoſe that thankfully embrace the good Proffers of Salvation, and come when they are called; that come with Reverence and Decency; clothed with the Wedding Garment, the white Robe of Righteouſneſs and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; that is, who take care to <note n="*" place="margin">Epheſ. IV. 1.</note> 
               <hi>walk worthy of the vocation, wherewith they are called</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes it) Theſe, and Theſe only are <hi>the Choſen;</hi> and They, it ſeems, are but <hi>Few;</hi> In Compariſon, God knows, but very Few.</p>
            <p>Concerning this Notion then, and Who are to be ranked under each of theſe Diviſions, the Controverſy is not very conſiderable. But what ſhould be the Cauſe of ſuch Diſparity in their numbers, mighty Doubts and Diſputes have riſen. Whence it is, that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Called,</hi> are not yet of the <hi>Choſen;</hi> whether from Him who calls,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49873:139"/> but never intends to chuſe all that he calls; or, whether from Them who are Called, but are not fit, or do not qualify themſelves, for being Choſen. Which is as much as to ſay, whether the Damnation of Mens Souls ought to lie at God's, or their own, Door; whether His Election be Abſolute, and Arbitrary, and Unconditional, ſo that Some ſhall not be <hi>choſen,</hi> though they would never ſo fain; Or whether it proceed upon Terms of Equity, and ſuch Juſtice, as we can judge of; ſo that no Man is rejected without his own Fault; and even thoſe who are not <hi>choſen,</hi> might have been, if they had not been wanting to themſelves. This is an Enquiry of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. And, to Them who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepoſſeſt, and will ſubmit to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the thing fairly, this Parable, I take it, is capable of giving great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. For it ſhews us plainly what the King did, and what his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects did not do; Why many of thoſe who were <hi>called</hi> did not come at all; and Why of thoſe that did come, all were not <hi>choſen;</hi> that is, not approved, and admitted to partake of the Feaſt. The deſign of which is to hint at the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:49873:140"/> of the Goſpel's being unſucceſsful in any reſpect, Either to Them that are without, or to Them that are within, and under its Diſpenſation; And what hinders, that Some, to whom it is preached, do not believe; and that ſome Believers are yet not ſaved by that Belief. For the Former ſort are repreſented by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Latter by the <hi>perſon without a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment:</hi> And, to ſatisfy this Argument, I ſhall handle each of the Caſes diſtinctly, and conſider what Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances the Parable takes notice of in Either of them; both Thoſe, which relate to the Perſon <hi>calling</hi> and <hi>chooſing,</hi> and thoſe, which concern the Perſons <hi>called,</hi> but not <hi>choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We are to examine the Caſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſet down from the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> to the <hi>Eighth</hi> Verſe; and to learn thence, if we can, why thoſe who were <hi>called</hi> did not <hi>come,</hi> or (which is the ſame thing in other words) wherefore Some, to whom the Goſpel is preached, do not accept and believe it. And, in order to the reſolving this Queſtion, we will look into the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Each Party; Of the King <hi>firſt</hi> that made, and <hi>then</hi> of the Subjects that refuſed, the Invitation.</p>
            <pb n="263" facs="tcp:49873:140"/>
            <p>On the King's Part Two things are conſiderable, The Preparations he made; And the Deſire he expreſt that men ſhould partake of them.</p>
            <p>The Former of theſe is deſcribed in the Parable, by <hi>making a Marriage for his Son, killing his Oxen and Fatlings,</hi> and taking care, that <hi>his dinner</hi> and <hi>all things ſhould be ready;</hi> For Theſe are properly the Preparing part there. And they ſeem to anſwer in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to God's ſending his Son in our Fleſh; The Deſign and the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that Myſtery, in ſuffering him to be born and to die for us, and all the neceſſary Proviſion made for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Converſion and future Happineſs. His Deſire that men ſhould partake of theſe Benefits manifeſts it ſelf, in bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to the Wedding, that is, in all ſorts of Warnings and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions given Men before-hand; by the Light of Nature; by particular Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations afforded to the Forefathers of theſe <hi>Jews;</hi> by the Precepts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Law; by the clearer Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the Prophets; by the Types and Figures of the Levitical Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and by all the Methods taken to inſtruct and prepare the World at a
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:49873:141"/> diſtance for reaping the Advantages of this Redemption. And again, when the Fullneſs of time was come, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his Servants upon a ſecond Meſſage to repeat this Call, at the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Son of God in Fleſh; And farther yet, when the Eſpouſals were now compleated, when the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Divine Feaſt was ſet out, and the Table ſpread, by ſlaying that Lamb, which is the Food of Souls, diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Meſſengers yet again and again; putting them in mind afreſh, preſſing, importuning, conjuring them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his Bounty; and at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting their unworthy and unkind Refuſals ſo heinouſly; and inflicting ſo ſevere a Puniſhment upon their Obſtinacy and Ingratitude: And, laſt of all, when theſe <hi>Jews</hi> had ſhewed themſelves proof, againſt ſo many gracious Means uſed to reduce them, by granting a freſh Commiſſion for making the ſame Offers to the Gentile World, that ſo his Deſigns of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might not be utterly defeated, but Theſe, by their Complyance, might gain an equal Title, to the Bleſſings which the Former had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited and juſtly loſt, through
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:49873:141"/> their inflexible Stubbornneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>From all theſe Circumſtances fairly put together, I do not ſee how we can, with any good Reaſon, avoid the ſubmitting our Aſſent to theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Concluſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>The Redemption of the World by the Incarnation and Death of Chriſt, was an Act of God's free Mercy, and marvellous Grace.</hi> This King did not marry his Son with a deſign to add to his Happineſs or his Honour. Thoſe were perfect before. But mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to exalt and ennoble the Spouſe he took. Nor had She any Charms to attract his Love, any Beauty or Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to feaſt his Sight, but was in her ſelf deformed, and ſcandalous, and poor. For it was wretched Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature that he married himſelf to; He laid aſide for a while the Rays of his Glory, to be clothed with the Rags of Fleſh; and a Church <note n="*" place="margin">Epheſ. V. 27. Reu. I. 7.</note> which (though now indeed <hi>without ſpot, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing,</hi> yet) was, when He firſt vouchſafed to pity, and to love her, of a quite different Form and Hue. For all her preſent Purity and Lovelineſs is owing to her being
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:49873:142"/> cleanſed and waſhed from her Sins in her Lord's blood. No Intereſt, no Honour was to be expected from a Match ſo mean, ſo much below this Prince; No End to be ſerved by it; No Argument to move it, but infinite Kindneſs and Compaſſion, that ſaw the Miſeries of wretched Humanity, and tenderly yearned over them; And, when no other relief could be had, condeſcended to take Our Miſeries, and make them his own; that ſo His Glory and Happineſs might become Ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It follows from hence, <hi>That the Mercy figured here by this Marriage was intended for the Benefit of Mankind.</hi> And This deſerves to be taken notice of, becauſe it differs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in from all other ſuch Solemnities, as the Parable ſhadows it to us under. For, whereas Perſons of the Firſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and greateſt Worth are uſually the only ones, that Princes admit to bear a part in their Rejoycings and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments; Here the meaner and more unworthy ſort have the Honour of the Day. The Angels are vaſtly Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to Us, in the Dignity and Excellence of their Nature; <hi>yet Chriſt</hi>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:49873:142"/> (as the Apoſtle obſerves) <hi>took</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. II. 16.</note> 
               <hi>not on him the Nature of Angels, but he took the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> Many of Them too were fallen as deep as We, yet to Us he extended Compaſſion, and to Them he did not. And therefore, of many Conſiderations, that recommend this Call to Grace and Salvation, this Condeſcenſion is not the leaſt, that, when Both were miſerable, and Both undeſerving, Thoſe of a Higher Rank were paſt by, and left out; and They of an Inferiour Condition were pitied and exalted; thought fit to have the Son of God joyned to Their Subſtance, admitted to ſit with him at his Table in his Kingdom; nay to be the very Bride and Beloved of the Lamb him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We may likewiſe gather from hence, <hi>That the Deſign of this Benefit was univerſal.</hi> For the Parable plainly deſcribes an Invitation ſent to all manner of People. Not to all at once, it is true, but firſt to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and afterwards, upon Their refuſal, to the Gentiles. So that, although ſome were preferred in point of Time and Order, yet both ſorts had their turn, and none were utterly excluded.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49873:143"/> The People and City of God had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect the firſt Proffers, but the Servants that were ſent out, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with theſe, did not ſtop there; For the <hi>Ninth</hi> Verſe commands <hi>them out again to the highways, and hedges;</hi> and <hi>to bid to the marriage</hi> all, as <hi>many as ever they ſhould find.</hi> This agrees exactly with thoſe large and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Terms, in which the Apoſtle's Commiſſion ran, when Chriſt after his Reſurrection charged them, <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. XXVIII. 19. Mark XVI. 16.</note> 
               <hi>to diſciple and baptize all nations,</hi> to <hi>Go out into all the world and preach the Goſpel to every Creature.</hi> And I know not what Other Demonſtration we would have, of God's deſigning, that All ſhould partake of this Spiritual Feaſt, than his taking ſuch Care, that All ſhould have due notice of it; and preſſing them over and over, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Meſſages to that purpoſe; St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſeems to argue, that <note n="†" place="margin">Tim. II. 4.</note> 
               <hi>God would have all men to be ſaved</hi> from his uſing means to bring <hi>them to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> And, with regard to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Expiation, He tells the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Heb. II. 9.</note> that Jeſus was <hi>made a little lower than the Angels, that He by the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49873:143"/> Grace of God ſhould taſt death for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man.</hi> The Deſign is not leſs uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal becauſe the Effect is not ſo; For St. <hi>Peter</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. II 1.</note> upbraids the men, who brought in damnable Hereſies, with <hi>denying the Lord that bought them, and ſo bringing upon themſelves deſtruction.</hi> And the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges moſt admirably, to ſhew the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of Providence, in converting the Obſtinacy of the <hi>Jews</hi> into an occaſion of bringing in the fullneſs of the Gentiles; that ſo the Converſion of the Gentiles might be alſo an occaſion of ſoftening the <hi>Jews,</hi> by working them up to a holy Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that Happineſs and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which thoſe deſpiſed Nations had ſo ſurpriſingly outſtripped them in. Some Perſons indeed there are, who deny the force of this Reaſon; and pretend, that God never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that thoſe who ſtood out, ſhould ever have come in; that he hardned their hearts, and made it impoſſible for them to hearken to, or comply with his Calls. But I add, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That <hi>God was very ſerious in theſe Invitations, and that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:49873:144"/> gives us ground ſufficient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſo.</hi> It is true, Among Men ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are done merely out of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony and Form; Many proffers made in hopes of being refuſed; Many Civilities ſhewn, where nothing leſs is intended; And what the World calls Complaiſance and good Breeding, is frequently not ſo much the Language, as the Diſguiſe, of the mind: And hard it is to know, whether it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from real Friendſhip, or be the Effect of Formality, or Flattery, or Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, or Fear. But This cannot poſſibly be the Caſe here. For to ſuppoſe Almighty God guilty of ſuch mean Arts, is to think moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, and moſt inconſiſtently of him. With Him is no Deceivableneſs, no Deceit: A thing ſo vile and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly baſe, that They who practice it moſt, are always aſhamed to own it; and therefore uſe their utmoſt induſtry to mask it well. Though Few in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon are ſincere, yet every Man is ambitious, and labours to be thought ſincere. And what the very Worſt of ſinful Mortals deteſts, is ſure a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter not to be aſcribed to the Beſt and Holieſt Being.</p>
            <pb n="271" facs="tcp:49873:144"/>
            <p>Again, As the Nature of God is not capable of any indirect or double Dealing, or falſe and flattering Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, ſo is there no imaginable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, from without, that ſhould incline him to make uſe of them. He cannot contract an Obligation from his own Creatures, nor can he ſtand in Awe of their Diſpleaſure. What then ſhould move him to profeſs Kindneſs, where none is due? What, where he cannot ſuffer by with-holding it? What indeed, but his own Infinite and Eſſential Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Can the Great God of Heaven and Earth gain any advantage by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating himſelf into the Affections, and courting the good Opinion, of poor Worms, who can never profit him by the beſt of their polluted and imperfect Services? He ſtands not in need of any Returns our Gratitude can make; Nor is his Happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective without them. And Common Senſe tells us, that, were Our State in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent upon the Favour or Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of one another, there would not be ſuch a thing, as a Flatterer or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler in the World. If then this King in the Parable did not deſign his Invitations ſhould be accepted, why
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:49873:145"/> did he ever make them at all? But at leaſt, when men refuſed them, why did he not take them at their word? A Complement, that is merely ſuch, is eaſily dropp'd: And when men are well enough pleaſed to be deny'd, they are uſually content to ſpare the trouble of preſſing. But is This at all agreeable to the Methods uſed here for bringing in Gueſts to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage? If the Firſt Bidding would bear ſo vile an Interpretation, yet ſure the Importunities of a Second and Third Call will by no means endure it. And yet leaſt of all will that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation for being ſo unworthily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; The New Commiſſions iſſued out to his Servants; The mighty Care of picking up other Gueſts; And the ſevere Revenge upon Thoſe, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his gracious Offers with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain. In all appearance, the doing what God all along intended men ſhould do, nay, what he made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them to do, ought not to have bred ſo irreconcilable a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.</p>
            <p>We acknowledge indeed, that the Counſels of Almighty God are a vaſt and dark Depth; and think, it very
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:49873:145"/> unbecoming poor feeble Mortals, too buſily to intrude into, or perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to pronounce concerning, them. But there are ſome plain Principles ſo obvious, that all contending Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cannot but agree in them. That the <hi>Judge of all the Earth</hi> cannot but <hi>do right,</hi> is a Truth univerſally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd. And, though Juſtice in God may proceed upon Meaſures not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by Us, and be perfect above what we are able to comprehend; yet ſince Juſt and Unjuſt, Good and Evil are not arbitrary and unalterable things, we have no reaſon to ſuppoſe, that Juſtice and Goodneſs in God are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what we eſteem Juſt and Good among Men. And therefore Men may be excuſed, if they think, that all the Caution and Jealouſy due to the Honour of God's Juſtice and Goodneſs have not been obſerved, by Some, who, out of honeſt Zeal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, have ſet up a ſecret Will in the Divine Decrees, which ſeems plainly repugnant to the Known Will of his Precepts, and Revelations. For if God will, that Any ſhould hear, and receive, and obey his Goſpel; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns this upon pain of Damnation;
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:49873:146"/> and hath in moſt ſolemn manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared this to be his Will; and yet at the ſame time hath another Will to us unknown, which controuls and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules all this; and will not ſuffer ſuch to receive and obey his Word, though they would never ſo fain; and then puniſhes and damns them eternally for not doing ſo; Let Them who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Doctrine tell us, how we ſhall deliver it from ſuch Reflections, upon the Honour, the Juſtice, the Goodneſs, the Truth, and (if I may be allowed ſo to ſpeak) the Sincerity and Common Honeſty of the Divine Nature, as Reverence to ſo Great a Majeſty will not ſuffer me to name. In Matters of ſo high a Nature, great Allowances may be made for unaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Miſtakes, and Difference in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But it can be no juſt matter of blame, to diſſent from thoſe Doctrines, the Conſequences of which even They that advance them profeſs to abhor, and yet have not ſhewn us how they can be avoided. For, ſo far as yet appears, if This be the caſe, <hi>our Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is vain, and your Faith is alſo vain.</hi> And therefore we have great Reaſon to conclude, that God does
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:49873:146"/> not obſtruct mens honeſt Endeavours in the uſe of Outward Means, but leaves them in their full Power; and that his Decrees are ſuch, as conſiſt very well with the Temper of his Covenants, his Exhortations, his Promiſes, his Threatnings, his vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and affectionate Expoſtulations, his laying the Sinner's Ruine at his own door, ſo frequently, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly recorded, in Scripture. Were it not thus, what wretched Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties are Chriſtians abandoned to, what terrible Anxieties and Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements muſt they labour under in their greateſt Concern? So great, that the beſt good Man could never tell, what he hath to truſt 10; And I know not, whether it might not truly be affirmed, that; upon theſe Terms, They, to whom Revelation and the Light of the Goſpel have come, are of <hi>all men moſt</hi> miſerable.</p>
            <p>Some Other Concluſions there are very proper upon this occaſion, but thoſe I muſt be ſatisfied with referring to my next Diſcourſe.</p>

            <p>MY Deſign in the Choice of theſe Words was to treat of that Calling and Election, whereby Men are at laſt brought to the obtaining that Salvation, which is purchaſed for them by Chriſt, and tendred to them in his Goſpel. And
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:49873:147"/> in this Undertaking I have made ſome Progreſs already, by a former Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By explaining the Parable of which my Text is the Concluſion, and ſhewing, who are the <hi>Called,</hi> and who the <hi>Choſen</hi> of God. That in the former Claſs are to be reckoned All, to whom the Invitations of this King, that is, the Word of God hath come; Whether they <hi>came to the marriage,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Invitations or not; Whether they receive or reject Chriſt preached to them. And All who came, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with or without the Wedding Garment; who do receive and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Truth, though they do not attain to all the Advantages of a true Faith, and Theſe are <hi>Many.</hi> But by the <hi>Choſen</hi> Thoſe only are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that thankfully and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully embrace the Proffers of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, by conforming their Lives to the Precepts of Chriſtianity in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs, are admitted as worthy Partakers of this Divine Feaſt. And Theſe it ſeems, in compariſon of the Numbers ſo <hi>Called</hi> as I have ſaid, are but <hi>Few.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="278" facs="tcp:49873:148"/>
            <p>But now, in regard that in order to our right Underſtanding, and receiving due Encouragement for the Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of, our Chriſtian Duty, it muſt needs import us highly to know, whence this ſo great Diſparity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds; and how it comes to paſs, that, where ſuch Means are plentfully of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, they become ſo ſeldom effectual; I proceeded to enquire, ſo far as we can receive Information from this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, whether ſuch Miſcarriages and Diſappointments are to be imputed to God, or to Mens own ſelves. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He never intended, that All who were <hi>Called</hi> ſhould be <hi>Choſen</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their moſt aſſiduous Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſo to be; Or whether every one ſo <hi>Called</hi> might alſo have been <hi>Choſen,</hi> if he had not ſome way or other been wanting to himſelf, in the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch Advantages, as that Call put into his hands. To this purpoſe I propoſed to conſider, both the Caſe of Them, who, when the Goſpel was preached to them, did not receive it; and of Thoſe others, who did receive it, but were not ſaved by virtue of their doing ſo. The former of Theſe is repreſented to us from the Firſt to the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:49873:148"/> Eleventh Verſe, under the Figure of the Obſtinate <hi>Jews, i.e.</hi> Them who came not in, when bidden to the Marriage; The Latter, by the Man who had <hi>not on a Wedding Garment,</hi> who is the Repreſentative of unſincere and Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>I am ſtill engaged in the Former of theſe Heads, and, for our forming a Judgment of that Caſe more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, did promiſe to ſet before you, both what this Parable relates to have been done by the King inviting his Gueſts; and what hindrances it takes notice of in thoſe Gueſts, as the Cauſes of their not complying with ſo gracious an Invitation.</p>
            <p>On the King's Part I ſhewed you the Circumſtances of this Parable plainly ſpeak Two things.
<list>
                  <item>I. <hi>The large and magnificent Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for entertaining the Gueſts;</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. <hi>The Deſire he expreſſed, and the repeated Endeavours he uſed, that the Perſons invited ſhould partake of them.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe Paſſages explained and applied to the Matter manifeſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:49873:149"/> by this Parable, I drew ſome Inferences, which to me ſeem unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to follow upon them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Redemption of the World by the Incarnation and Death of our Bleſſed Saviour was an Act of God's free Mercy, and marvellous Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Mercy, figured here by the <hi>King's making a Marriage for his Son,</hi> was intended for the Benefit of Mankind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Deſign of this Benefit was Univerſal, or, as our Church in her excellent Catechiſm moſt truly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, that the Son of God <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed all Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That in the Methods made uſe of to prepare and qualify men for ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring this Univerſal Redemption ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to themſelves in particular, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God was very ſerious and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere; and did not, by any fatal Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity decreed by his ſecret Will, render it impoſſible for them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his revealed Will.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to ſome Other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, for which the Paſſage before
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49873:149"/> us ſeems to be a very juſt Foundation. For inſtance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We may obſerve from hence, that, (commonly ſpeaking) the Manner and Method, by which God calls Men, is the Outward Miniſtry of his Word, and other Ordinary and Stated Means of Grace. The Servants of this King anſwer to God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, regularly ſent and appointed in the Church: Whoſe eſtabliſhed Order and Buſineſs it is to publiſh their Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage diligently, to make the Will and gracious Intentions of their Maſter known to all People; to proclaim the Tidings, and explain the Terms, of Salvation; To inſtruct, exhort, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, encourage, promiſe, threaten, according to the Tenure of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; and, by all prudent and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Care, to urge, and prevail upon their Hearers, that they would not neglect, or obſtinately refuſe their own Mercy. So that our reſpective Congregations are to know, they meet with, and are taught by God, in the Holy Scriptures, in the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the Prayers of the Church, and in all the Ordinances of the true Religion. It was not of our Lord's
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:49873:150"/> immediate Diſciples alone, but of all their Lawful Succeſſors to the World's End, that thoſe Words in St. <hi>Luke</hi> are to be underſtood, <note n="*" place="margin">Luke X. 16.</note> 
               <hi>He that heareth You, heareth Me; and He that deſpiſeth You, deſpiſeth Me; and He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth Me, deſpiſeth him that ſent Me.</hi> And whatever wild Dreams ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may have of I know not what imaginary Inward Calls; <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſt. Tom. 5. Pag. 291. Ed. Eton.</note> Such, I mean, as pretend to defer their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or receiving the Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or the like, upon the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of waiting for ſome powerful, diſtinct, and expreſs Call; and not thinking the Arguments of their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and the unanſwerable Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of their own Reaſon that theſe things ought to be done, ſufficient Motives for going about them; Theſe, it is much to be feared, are vain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, the Deluſions of Melancholy or Sloth, and dangerous Suggeſtions of the Tempter, who manages ſuch Miſtakes to his own wicked purpoſes, and knows, that Delay is the broad way to Deſtruction. God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed provided an Inward Call, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and ſet home the Outward up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Conſciences. But he hath not
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:49873:150"/> any where that I know of (in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Diſpenſations of his Grace and Providence) promiſed any Inward Call apart from the Outward, where this may be had. He bleſſes, I mean, the Adminiſtration of his Word and Sacraments, and hath fitted theſe as proper Inſtruments for bringing us to himſelf. But he expects we ſhould uſe theſe, that by them we may be brought to him. So that (as I had occaſion to obſerve formerly) <note place="margin">Serm. VI<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> every Publick Sermon, every Pſalm and Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Service, every Bidding of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, every pious Exhortation, Admonition, Reproof, is God's Call, and God's Meſſage, conveyed down to us by his Miniſters, and ſuch as we muſt expect one day to account for. The King in this Parable interpreted the Refuſal, and the Ill Treatment of his Servants, as ſo many Indignities done to himſelf; and revenged them with a Severity proportionable to an Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſo reſented. And the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom thoſe ungrateful Wretches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, were utterly deſtroyed, for not hearkening to ſuch Calls as theſe. This is the Condemnation conſtantly
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:49873:151"/> laid to their Charge, that God <hi>ſent his Prophets, and they would not hear.</hi> And That which was Their ruine, will certainly prove Ours in the End; if We, by wicked Delays, and ſtanding out againſt the like Means, follow the Example of their Obſtinacy, and Contemptuous Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> From hence I take it to be evident, that this Ordinary and Outward Miniſtration mentioned in my laſt Particular, is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Sufficient Call, to as many as are rightly diſpoſed, and willing to make a due Improvement of it. Were not the Matter thus, how could we account for the <hi>Jews</hi> being ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully puniſh'd, upon denying their Aſſent and Obedience? How for the <hi>Gentles</hi> ſucceeding ſo well, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch commendation, upon a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy complyance with ſuch Calls? Since neither is it any juſt provocation to with-hold our Obedience from, nor any Virtue or real Matter of Praiſe to give in raſhly, to Motives and Means, which are inſufficient. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and moſt readily confeſs'd, that all the Succeſſes of Outward Means
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:49873:151"/> upon us, are entirely owing to the Bleſſing and Grace of God, inclining our Wills to accept and ſubmit to them. But the thing I aim at in this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is, To urge, that when, in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations as This before us, and other-like places of Scripture, the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means alone are taken notice of, and no mention made of the Inward Aſſiſtances neceſſary to render them ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; This is a fair Intimation, nay, I think I may ſay, an undenyable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that God's Inward Call will not be wanting to ſecond the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, where men are ſincere and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, deſirous and diligent to examine, and conſider, to hearken to reaſon, (all Paſſions and Prejudice, and Intereſt apart,) and reſolutely ſet to follow the Dictates of God and their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. <note n="*" place="margin">Matth.

               <hi>Him that cometh to Me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Nor would I here again be underſtood, as if I ſuppoſed, that even thoſe Actions or good Diſpoſitions, to which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Grace is promiſed, are things
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:49873:152"/> meerly in our own power. No ſuch matter. Our very <hi>Having,</hi> our very <hi>Coming,</hi> are of God; His are the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and His the ability of uſing them faithfully. <note place="margin">John XV. 5. V. 44.</note>

Now thus much ſeems to be implyed in the many ſevere Reproofs and Upbraidings, in the many paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and tender Complaints, to be met with upon theſe occaſions. <note place="margin">John V. 40.</note>

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:49873:152"/> hand, appears from that remarkable Text to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> where St. <hi>Paul</hi> preſſes them to <note place="margin">Phil. II. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>work out their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling, becauſe it is God who worketh in them to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> To this we may add the conſtant cuſtom of charging mens Faults, and Puniſhments, and final Deſtruction, upon themſelves, obſervable throughout the whole Book of Scripture. And, where mention is made of God's hardening men's hearts, if we will make that Book conſiſtent with it ſelf, This is to be meant, of God's doing it by way of Judgment upon wicked Sinners, puniſhing the Abuſe of Means by a total Deprivation of them, Mens own Folly by Infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Thus blinding thoſe Eyes which would not ſee, and preſerving the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited lives of ſome notorious Monſters in Impiery, from that ſpeedy death they had deſerved, to make them more awakening examples to Others, by the vengeance which purſues their repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed provocations in this World. But, which comes cloſeſt up to the preſent purpoſe, The Neglects, and Contempts, and Abuſes, threaten'd or revenged in our Bibles, are all along ſuch as men had
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:49873:153"/> been guilty of towards Outward and Ordinary means. For not being won by theſe, they are declared inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Which yet they could not be, were they not provided with ſuch helps, as, attended with their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Honeſty, might have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thoſe means ſucceſsful. For this is but in other words to affirm, what the Holy Spirit frequently does, that the Sinners undoing is not from God; but from himſelf: not from <hi>Him who deſireth not the Death of the Wicked,</hi> but from the Wicked who will <hi>not turn and live.</hi>

We likewiſe ſee and know, that God does not call all people alike: To ſome he vouchſafes to ſpeak lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as it were, and affords more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and awakening alarms, than he does to Others. Thus he did to St. <hi>Paul;</hi> but ſtill even That Converſion, though miraculous, was in part owing to the reſign'd and honeſt diſpoſition of his mind, which anſwered to the Call from Heaven, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me do?</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> hath employed a great part of one of his Sermons, to ſhew what a diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement it is to the Virtue of this Great Apoſtle, to ſuppoſe his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Effect of Neceſſity.

               </note> that <q rend="inline">if the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles here had a power of working neceſſarily, the ſame miracles muſt have produced the ſame effects upon all occaſions. But this 'tis plain they did not do. It was not then
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:49873:154"/> (ſays he) the Light, or Voice from Heaven that wrought this Change, for that Evidence the <hi>Jews</hi> had at our Saviour's Baptiſm, and yet They were not changed by it. It was not his being ſtruck down to the Ground; for ſo were the Officers who came to apprehend Jeſus in the Garden; and yet They deſiſted not from their wicked attempts. It was not his Blindneſs; for this was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly inflicted upon <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer too, and yet we do not find that He was at all the better for it. And therefore, if we will be juſt to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Character, we muſt not rob him of the Glory of conſenting, but muſt allow it to be his own Act, and Deed, and ſo reſolve the Succeſs at laſt into his Willingneſs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with this Miracle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After all which, and a great deal more to the ſame purpoſe, that Father proceeds in the following manner. <q rend="inline">This is what I deſire you to take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice of; That God does not compel them that are unwilling. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>No man cometh to me, except the Father draw him.</hi> Now he draws the man that is willing to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:49873:154"/> be drawn, that lyes indeed, but ſtretches out his hand to be lifted up. And, to teach you by theſe words, that he forces None; but if <hi>God</hi> be willing, and We be not, the means of ſalvation fall to the ground; Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe His Will is weak, but becauſe he will not ſave any man againſt his Own Will. This is very neceſſary to be inſiſted on, becauſe ſlothful men take Sanctuary in ſuch vain pretences, as theſe; and, when they are urged to the Sacraments, and a better Life, preſently anſwer, <hi>When God thinks fit, he will convince, and make me a new man.</hi> I do not blame ſuch for attributing this change to the Will of God; but would have them do their own parts, and ſo depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on His good pleaſure. For if thou be lazy and negligent, and never ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt about a good life, and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt to wait God's leiſure, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are never like to be better with thee. For as I ſaid, no man is brought to God by violence and compulſion, but he is always ready to ſave the willing and well-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Men indeed command and will have things done, whether their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:49873:155"/> will or no; becauſe Maſters among Men do not conſult their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants advantage, but their own. But our Maſter in Heaven, who is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and would have thee ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that he is not either in any need of, or at all better by, any thing we can do, deſires our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, purely for our own advantage; And if we pay this with becoming thankfulneſs, we ſerve not any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of His, but reap all the profit of it our ſelves. And therefore He will not preſs the unwilling and refractory into his Service, thereby to ſhew, that He is not beholding to Us for ſerving, but We to Him for commanding.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From all this it may appear, that the Difference of the Diſpoſition is the main thing, which makes the Succeſs of one man differ from that of another, in the uſe of the means of Grace. 'Twas This diſtinguiſh'd the perſons in the Parable: This hindred them who were firſt bidden from coming to the Feaſt; and brought in the wanderers laſt call'd, from the High-ways: It rendred (that is) the Preaching and Miracles of our Saviour of ſo great effect to thoſe who
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:49873:155"/> in all appearance were leaſt, and of ſo little to them who were moſt, likely to have profited by them. It is the fondeſt imagination in the world, to complain, that we cannot edify by our Miniſters, and to have Their perſons in undue admiration or Contempt. Alas! we judge quite wrong in this matter. The Succeſs of the Doctrine depends principally, not upon the Speaker but, the Hearers. The Tongues of Men or Augels ſignifie little, if the Heart of thoſe who receive the word, do not receive it with meekneſs and pure Affection. And the Seed of Grace, as well as that of the Word, may be Scattered to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, though the Sower diſtribute it with never ſo liberal a hand, if the Ground Sown be like the Way-ſide, or the Rock, or the Thorns. In ſhort, the <hi>Jews</hi> have put this point beyond all diſpute; who were neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by all the wonders <hi>Jeſus</hi> could do, nor perſwaded by all that he could ſay; And yet at the ſame time, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>he did among them the works which no other man did;</hi> and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, he <hi>ſpoke as never man ſpoke.</hi>

            <p n="2">II. This leads me to conſider, in the Next place, thoſe Hinderances, by which They heretofore, and Wicked men proportionably in all Ages of the World, are kept back from the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Truth. In order whereunto we muſt conſider the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of theſe unthankful Subjects, who refuſed their King's moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Invitations. Now theſe the Parable hath diſtributed into Three Sorts, and in each of them hath point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out a particular Spirit, which ſeems to have been the Occaſion of their Stubbornneſs and Contempt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Firſt of theſe I take to be meant by Them, who, as the Third Verſe tells us, <hi>would not come.</hi> And theſe men's Indiſpoſition ſeems to be Pride and Diſreſpect. Such were They, who took offence at the meanneſs of the Son of God's appearance in the Fleſh. A reputed Carpenter's Son, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a few illiterate Fiſhermen; addreſſing himſelf to perſons of all Conditions, with all the marks of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and Meekneſs, and Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; Living in a State of Poverty, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:49873:156"/> dying in all the Circumſtances of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy and Scorn, and Reproach. Theſe things gave great diſguſt to the <hi>Jews;</hi> whoſe minds, prepoſſeſſed with falſe notions of a <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> expected a temporal Prince and Conquerour; one that ſhould make his way, and erect his Throne, by all the awful methods of Pomp, and Splendour, and Bloody Victories. And therefore finding <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> make a Figure ſo very oppoſite to what they had conceived of Chriſt, they treated Him and his Doctrine with the utmoſt Contumely and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.</p>
            <p>And in Thoſe mens ſteps may all They be very juſtly eſteem'd to tread at this day, who look upon Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as a low and deſpicable diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; A Religion cut out only for ſuch as its firſt Preachers were, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men of Letters, and Honour, and Condition: Who are ſcandalized at the Croſs of Chriſt, and make the Death he ſubmitted to for our ſakes a Subject of ſcornful Railery and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Scoffs; Who deſpiſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as a Syſtem of Faith and Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, fit only for ſuch credulous and eaſy, ſuch poor and little Souls, as
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:49873:157"/> can give up their Aſſent to Myſteries above their comprehenſion, can tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put up injuries and affronts, crucify themſelves to the World in hope of unſeen and very diſtant Rewards, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the preſent pleaſures of Sin, engage in a perpetual War with ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Appetite, and ſtand in awe of that Bugbear, Conſcience. To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe can it be, to invite Men of ſuch a carnal Palate to this Spiritual Feaſt. Before thoſe Calls can have effect, they muſt abandon their falſe Notions of Gallantry, and Greatneſs, and Good Senſe. They muſt be brought down to ſuch a Temper, as is fit to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, will hearken to better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and is content to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>That</hi> God is wiſer than We; And, <hi>that</hi> He is the beſt Judge, what Virtues are beſt qualified to perfect the Nature himſelf gave us, and what meaſures were moſt proper to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for repairing the breaches Sin had made upon it: <hi>That</hi> He, who alone can forgive Sin, hath alone right to determine upon what conditions it ſhall be forgiven, and to chooſe his own Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. And, <hi>that</hi> it becomes loſt Wretches to admire and adore his
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:49873:157"/> Goodneſs, and to conclude, that the Methods of their Redemption were certainly adjuſted with infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; what Fooliſhneſs ſoever vain Man, when proceeding upon the falſe principles of Worldly prudence, might be apt to ſuſpect in them. Till this <hi>ſhperfluity of Nanghtineſs</hi> be pruned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, till Men entertain reverent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of God, and are ſatisfied, that <hi>His ways are not as Our Ways, nor His thoughts as Our Thoughts,</hi> though ten thouſand Meſſages were ſent to call them to <hi>the Marriage,</hi> they are like to continue the ſame ſturdy, haughty Jews ſtill; and <hi>will not come</hi> in.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another ſort are mentioned v. 5. who, upon pretence of ſome more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant concerns, made <hi>light of</hi> this Feaſt, and went, <hi>One to his Farm, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to his Merchandiſe.</hi> They gave the Meſſengers the hearing, but did not think the Invitation worth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, when it muſt hinder other Buſineſs. And ſuch are all They now, whom Riches, and Preferments, and worldly Cares keep from becoming good Chriſtians. The Feaſt is what they like well enough, provided the King would ſo far condeſcend, as to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:49873:158"/> admit them, when they are at leiſure to wait on him. They have nothing to object againſt Religion, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the advantages it offers to be very noble and alluring; And Good Men they fully deſign to be at ſome more convenient Seaſon; But at preſent their hands are ſo full, that till they can diſengage themſelves of ſome weighty and indiſpenſable affairs, it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to attend to that, which they wiſh with all their hearts they were free for. Now here is the main Difficulty, that Godwill not accept of divided Affections; This Feaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a new Appetite, and a refined Taſt; it expects the Chief of our Pains, and the moſt ſerious of our Thoughts. This is the <hi>Camel,</hi> that cannot get <note place="margin">Mark X. 24. 25.</note> 
               <hi>through the Eye of the Needle,</hi> and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it impoſſible for ſuch, as <hi>truſt,</hi> and delight, and place their happineſs in <hi>Riches,</hi> or any preſent Enjoyments, ſo as for their ſakes to neglect and diſeſteem a future and Spiritual Good, even <hi>to enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Serm. XI.</note> But with theſe Men I propoſe to diſcourſe more particularly hereafter, and ſhall therefore wave entring into the Argument with them now.</p>
            <pb n="299" facs="tcp:49873:158"/>
            <p n="3">3. A <hi>Third</hi> Sort of People, yet worſe than both the former, we read of at the <hi>ſixth Verſe;</hi> who, not content to reject the Invitation, fell foul upon them that brought it; They took <hi>the Servants, and entreated them ſpightfully, and ſlew them.</hi> Theſe gave themſelves no trouble about making excuſes, but added to their perverſe Rudeneſs, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and Malice, and Rage; or, to ſay the ſofteſt thing ſuch behaviour will bear, the Fury of an undiſciplin'd and miſtaken Zeal. And how blind, how blood-thirſty this was, our Lord hath acquainted us, in that prediction of his Diſciples Sufferings, that <hi>the time was</hi> coming, <note place="margin">John XVI. 2.</note> when <hi>whoſoever killed them, ſhould think he did God Service.</hi> Such were heretofore the Crucifiers of our Bleſſed Saviour. Such the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians; And ſuch are all thoſe ſtill, who openly oppoſe the Name of Chriſt, vilifie his Miniſters, and are profeſs'd Patrons of Infidelity, and Profaneneſs; Such alſo They, who, under pretence of more vigorouſly promoting or maintaining what they call the Truth, attack thoſe of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion with Sword, and Fire,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:49873:159"/> and Faggot: Who rend and tear their Saviour's Myſtical Body in ſunder; and advance that (not unchriſtian only, but even) unnatural Principle, that it is the duty of One Member, to pluck out, and to cut off Another.</p>
            <p>That which aggravates the Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of theſe Refuſals yet more, is the very nature of the Invitation it ſelf. Now This was not to Labour and Hardſhip, but to a Marriage, a Feaſt of Joy, a King's Feaſt; To which it is a mark of ſingular favour, and a mighty condeſcenſion, to be ſo ſollicitouſly importun'd, ſo kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. And the Chriſtian Religion is very fitly reſembled by this Figure, both in compariſon of that Yoke of Servitude it delivers us from, and with regard to the exquiſite Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the unſpeakable Glories, which all who embrace it ſincerely are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made partakers of. Had we been call'd to Toil and great Drudgery, even ſo God had a right to command our Obedience; Had he bid us do ſome unprofitable, ſome very harſh and unpleaſant thing, we ought not to have declin'd it. How much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould we comply, when he ſays,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:49873:159"/> 
               <hi>Come unto the Marriage?</hi> And ſure this ſingle Circumſtance, that Men will not be perſwaded to their own advantage, is ſufficicient to ſhew us, where the fault truly lyes: And that, when the Maſter of the Feaſt, after having made ſuch proviſion for his Gueſts, and done ſo much to bring them to it, is requited only with Slights, and Obſtinacy, and Malice; Wicked Men are reprobated and ſhut out, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God did not do all that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a gracious King to do; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, when they were bidden in the moſt affectionate manner, yet they were not, would not be, worthy.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Having ſpoken ſo largely to the caſe of Them, who when the Goſpel is preached to them, do not receive it; I come now very briefly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider That Other, of <hi>ſuch as do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain and profeſs, but yet are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by it.</hi> For This anſwers to the Perſon, who did come, and yet was afterwards thruſt out for want of a <hi>Wedding-Garment.</hi> What this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſignifies, ſeems not very hard to be underſtood. Moſt Interpreters agree it to be <hi>Good Works in general,</hi> to which I would only beg leave to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:49873:160"/> add, <hi>ſuch works done out of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſincere Obedience.</hi> For, ſince the want of this Garment does not appear to have been diſcovered, till the Maſter came in to ſee and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Gueſts; though the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in Parables are not to be too curiouſly inſiſted upon, yet I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it is not amiſs to take in Inward Holineſs here, in oppoſition to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled formal Shew of Religion. Now This is what may be ſo nicely wrought, that no humane Eye ſhall be able to diſtinguiſh it. But God will be ſure to unmask the Hypocrite; He ſees through all our Diſguiſes, and will one day ſever, not only between the openly Righteous and the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but between Him that is Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in reality, and Him that is ſo in Affectation and Appearance only.</p>
            <p>This then is a ſeaſonable warning to all of us, <note place="margin">Phil. I. 27. Epheſ. IV. 23, 24. 1 Pet. III. 15. Epheſ.

               </gap>, which hinder men from entertaining the Chriſtian Doctrine, do likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the conforming their lives in good earneſt, to the Doctrines they entertain. The ſame is farther mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt from this Perſon's puniſhment here and from his being <hi>Speechleſs;</hi> ſtruck dumb with Guilt and Confuſion. Which fairly intimates to us, what is moſt certainly true; That, of all Men living, They who pretend to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians will have leaſt to ſay in their own excuſe, if they lead wicked lives; ſince This is in effect to profeſs one
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:49873:161"/> Rule, and act by another; and to live, not only in oppoſition to God and his Laws, but under a perpetual upbraiding of their own Breaſts, and in a perfect and conſtant contradiction to themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now All this tends directly to the End I chiefly aimed at in the Choice of this Subject. Which is, to remove moſe diſcouragements to Repentance and a Good Life, which ſome weak Minds may labour under, from a miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Notion, that theſe things will, either be done without us, or not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually attain'd even by our moſt labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and conſcientious Endeavours. And though may be objected, that Parables afford but little matter for ſolid Argument; yet the Cauſe I have undertaken will not be much weakned by that pretence, if it be remembred, thaat we may, and ought to argue from Parables, ſo far as the Reaſon and plain Deſign of them leads us; And that nothing here hath been advanced beyond that, which is not (I hope ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently) evinced by other expreſs Texts of Scripture. Let us not then flatter our ſelves with little Shifts, and take Sanctuary in the dark excuſes of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:49873:162"/> abſolute Reprobation and Election; For, be aſſured, that, at the General Day of Account, a new and different Scene of things ſhall open: And what Cloaks ſoever Men may contrive to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their ſhame in the mean while, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mouth ſhall then be laid in the duſt, <hi>All fleſh ſhall not only be, but acknowledge it ſelf to be guilty before God; And He be juſtified in all his Doings, and clear when he is judged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sum then of what hath been ſaid upon the matter is This: <hi>That</hi> God <hi>calls</hi> freely, whom, and when, and how he pleaſes; that every body is <hi>Called</hi> to whom the Word of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſent; and Called in ſuch a manner, that if They, who live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, do not hear, and receive, and profit by it, the Fault and the Puniſhment will be Theirs. That this hearing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, or (which is the ſame thing) <hi>coming when Called,</hi> implies, not only a Belief of what our Saviour hath taught, but living in agreement to the Principles Chriſtians profeſs to believe. That They who wilfully fail in either of theſe Points, cannot be of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of God's <hi>Choſen:</hi> They may be
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:49873:162"/> 
               <hi>Called,</hi> and not <hi>Come;</hi> they may <hi>Come,</hi> and yet be thruſt out as unworthy. And none are the <hi>Choſen,</hi> but ſuch as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Feaſt. From whence we may infer, that the Election of God proceeds upon certain Terms and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications; And, although Men are <hi>Called</hi> by an Act of Mercy purely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, and without any reſpect to their Behaviour, yet they are not <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> ſo. Freely indeed they are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not for any deſert or real worth of their Beſt Works; but conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtill, becauſe not without Good Works. So that theſe Works, though incapable of being the <hi>Meritorious,</hi> are yet the <hi>Instrumental</hi> Cauſe of our <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and Salvation. Hence <hi>Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> ſays, <note place="margin">Theoph. in loc.</note> 
               <hi>That we are Called is entirely Gids act; but whether we be Choſen or no, will depend upon our Selves.</hi> Hence a much more inconteſtable Authority than His warns Chriſtians, <note place="margin">2 Pet. I. 10.</note> 
               <hi>that they give diligence to make their. Calling and Election ſure:</hi> Which implies, that without their own diligence theſe things will not be ſecured to them. And indeed, as the Commentator I juſt now mentioned obſerves, Becauſe God is ſo very kind and bountiful in
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:49873:163"/> doing His part, and Men ſo very neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and inſenſible in Theirs; He bids, but <hi>they who are bidden are not worthy;</hi> this is the true reaſon, why ſo <hi>many are called,</hi> and yet ſo <hi>few are choſen.</hi>

            <p>THE Divine Diſcourſes, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 1.</note> with which our Lord entertained the Company, while dining with one of the chief <hi>Phariſees,</hi> made
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:49873:164"/> ſuch impreſſion upon them, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perſon then at meat with him, broke out into theſe words, <note place="margin">

               <hi>Bleſſed is He, that ſhall eat bread in the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon our Saviour takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſhew, that this Bleſſedneſs, great as it is, was not however embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with that eagerneſs and ſatisfaction, nor ſought with all that induſtry, which it moſt juſtly deſerved. And, for the Illuſtration of this ſad Truth, the Succeſſes of the Goſpel, and the different Reception it found among Men, are repreſented under the Figure of a <hi>Great Supper</hi> prepared, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 16.</note> and the Behaviour of the Gueſts invited to it. Some abſenting themſelves upon frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous pretences; Others rudely refuſing the Civility; And the Maſter of the Feaſt by this means driven to furniſh his Table, with ſtrangers of a meaner Quality; and full of juſt Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Reſentment againſt thoſe unworthy People, who denied to grace his Houſe with their preſence, and put ſuch a ſlight upon his kindneſs.</p>
            <p>This is the Subſtance of the Parable, and the Applications of it are various. For, whether we reſpect the Firſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:49873:164"/> diſcrimination made between the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> Or whether That more continuing one, of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Degrees and Qualifications of Men in all Ages and Countries; It ſets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Eyes a lively Image of Both, and is, in Either ſenſe, capable of great Uſe for our Inſtruction and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Former of Theſe, wherein the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, I have <note n="*" place="margin">Serm. IX. x.</note> already ſpoken ſo largely, that it will be needleſs again to inſiſt upon it. And therefore the only Reflection I ſhall make at preſent upon this ſenſe of the Parable, regards one expreſſion peculiar to this place. Which is, That thoſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> fetched from the <hi>High-ways</hi> and <hi>Hedges,</hi> are ſaid here to be <hi>Compelled to come in;</hi> Not from any external or irreſiſtible Neceſſity made uſe of to reduce them; But by the Evidence of Miracles, By the powerful Convictions of Truth, By the ſtrength of Arguments, By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Meſſages, By all the prevailing Arts of a holy Importunity; Which ſubdued their Wills, and brought over their Affections, and, in a manner, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted their Aſſent, while Luſt and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:49873:165"/> Worldly Inclinations perſwaded the contrary. So that this Expreſſion of <hi>Compelling,</hi> means only an exceeding Care, and ſolicitous Application to win them over; And the marvellous Efficacy of thoſe Methods at laſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Appetites of corrupt Nature, the Prejudices of Education and long Cuſtom, and all the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which the Habits and the Love of Evil could raiſe in Minds violently bent againſt any ſuch Compliance. And, when They had thus accepted the Invitation, then follows a ſevere, though moſt deſerved ſentence of utter Excluſion, upon thoſe other inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ungrateful Creatures, who had provoked this Good Man of the Houſe, and affronted his Intentions of favour toward them, by the obſtinacy and folly of excluding themſelves.</p>
            <p>To proceed then. The Relation this Parable bears to Perſons of ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and Qualifications, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is not leſs worthy our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. The Event of the Goſpel's firſt ſetting out, ſo different among the Poor, the Unlettered, the notorious Sinners; from what it was with the Wealthy, the Learned, the ſeeming
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:49873:165"/> Righteous. The Men of ſplendid Fortunes and eminent Poſts deriding its Doctrines of Humility and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Self-denial and Contempt of the World; while thoſe of inferior Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, whoſe Spirits and Tempers were of a ſize with their Eſtates, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted gladly to Them. The perſons of Study and Attainments deluding themſelves with vain Sophiſtry, and ſcorning the ſublime Myſteries of its Faith; while thoſe of Honeſter Minds, and Leſs Subtlety ſubdued their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and brought every proud aſpiring Thought into Captivity to the Power, and Wiſdom, and Truth of God. The pretenders to Sanctity, and rigid Obſervers of Ceremony and Tradition, preſuming upon their own Merits for Juſtification; while Others, of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation more liable to Cenſure, with thanks and joy inexpreſſible, laid hold on the Sacrifice and Propitiation of Another; and, conſcious of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence of Works alone, ſought Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> So that, in each of theſe reſpects, thoſe who <hi>were bidden,</hi> that is, who had received moſt from God, and ought to have been the forwardeſt in Duty
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:49873:166"/> to him; ſtood out; And They, whoſe Character was leſs conſiderable, and leſs could be expected from, were found moſt ready to expreſs their ſenſe of his Goodneſs, and moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to partake of it.</p>
            <p>Once more; There is yet Another Interpretation of this Parable, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the Circumſtances of thoſe People, among whom the Goſpel is already profeſs'd, and eſtabliſhed. For the End of Our Teaching and of Your Believing being Practice, as the End of that Practice is the Saving of Men's Souls; The Kingdom of Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after is no leſs ſhadowed out by this Feaſt, than the Kingdom of Grace here. And conſequently, All that neglect their Duty, and prefer the Buſineſs, or Enjoyments of This World, before their Concern for the Next, do refuſe the Invitations to this Spiritual Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and incur the Guilt and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation implied in the Text; As, on the Other hand, They, who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the diſadvantages of Perſon or Fortune, conform to the Rules of holy Living, and make Heaven their firſt and greateſt care; Theſe are the Men who fill the Houſe, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:49873:166"/> of that Supper. And, This ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification being equally proper, and more pertinent and ſuitable to Our Condition than Either of the Former; I ſhall endeavour to fix my own and your attention upon it, by conſidering theſe two General Heads:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, <hi>The Juſtice of thoſe Men's lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Heaven and Happineſs, who, for any Worldly Reſpects, refuſe the proffers of it made to them.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, <hi>The Great Mercy and Goodneſs of God in the means uſed for the Converſion of thoſe who do accept, and profit under, them.</hi> For upon theſe Two Points the whole Subſtance of the Paſſage turns, and They together make up the Moral of this Figurative Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us conſider, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God in debarring thoſe Men any Acceſs to Heaven and Happineſs hereafter, who refuſe the proffers of it made to them here. For that is the Importance of the Twenty fourth Verſe, <hi>I ſay unto You, that none of Thoſe men which were bidden, ſhall taſte of my
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49873:167"/> Supper.</hi> This, though laſt in order of the Text, yet becauſe depending upon that which is firſt in the Parable, I chuſe to begin with. And, for the clearer Manifeſtation of the Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, Theſe two things ſhould be attended to:
<list>
                  <item>(1.) <hi>The Character and Condition of the Refuſers;</hi> and then,</item>
                  <item>(2.) <hi>The Inſufficiency of thoſe Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they made for themſelves.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>The Character and Condition of them who abſented, is eaſily to be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Excuſes made to ſoften their Refuſal.</hi> Three whereof are poſitively alledged here, as ſent back by Three Perſons reſpectively. The firſt ſaid, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 18, 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>I have bought a piece of Ground, and I muſt needs go and ſee it;</hi> The ſecond is, <hi>I have bought five Yoke of Oxen, and I go to prove them;</hi> And the third, <hi>I have married a Wife, and therefore I cannot come.</hi> The Two former of Theſe will fall under the ſame deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and the ground of their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting ſeems to proceed from the ſame Cauſe; Which is, <hi>The Love of the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:49873:167"/> World, and immoderate purſuits of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and Riches.</hi> For, the Wealth of thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries conſiſting part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Land, and partly in Cattel, Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ice is the diſtemper common to them both. The Third is more properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to <hi>Love of Pleaſure,</hi> and <hi>Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Senſual Delights;</hi> which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſome ſigns of a worſe and more untractable Diſpoſition along with it. Thus much Some have thought intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the differing Forms in which the Anſwers are returned. For, whereas the Purchaſers of Land and Oxen, make a ſhew at leaſt of Civility and Modeſty, deſire the Servant to make their Excuſe, and expreſs ſome ſort of Concern, that their Weightier Affairs detain'd them; He that had <hi>married a Wife,</hi> in a more blunt and ſullen man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, replies roughly, <hi>I cannot come;</hi> A Reply, which ſpeaks that Air of Scorn, uſual in Men abandoned to <hi>Senſe,</hi> and <hi>Appetite;</hi> Who diſdain eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing and every Perſon, whoſe Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and Aim it is to divert them from ſuch preſent Gratifications. This like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is farther remarkable in all Three; That our Lord introduces, not the bold and daring Sinners, defiers of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:49873:168"/> God and good Manners, and ſuch as by long ſhameleſs Vice have worn out all Diſtinctions between Good and Evil; But ſuch as indulge thoſe Cares, and thoſe Pleaſures only, which in their own Nature are lawful and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable. He ſets before us, not the Vile Oppreſſor, the Impious Perjured, or the Actors of Violence and Rapine, of Forgery or Fraud; But Men intent upon their own Affairs, Patterns of Provident and Honeſt Induſtry, ſo far as the Quality of the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves is concerned. Had he done otherwiſe, we ſhould be apt to fancy, that no degree of Anxiety had been Criminal, ſo long as our hands were clean of Injuſtice and Deceit; As we were cautious not to heap polluted Treaſures, nor give our ſelves the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of being foul and diſhoneſt in our Dealings. Or Had he inſtanced in Adulterers, in Lewd and Impudent Senſuality, that proſtitutes Mens Souls, their Bodies, their Tongues, to Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Luſt; We might imagine none could be to blame, in giving ſcope to looſe Deſires, and fleſhly Satisfactions; And that no Bounds, no Laws reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Pleaſures, where Modeſty and
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:49873:168"/> Decency were obſerved, where no Man's Property had been Invaded, no injured Bed, or violated Honour, could be laid to our Charge. But now by producing honeſt Purchaſes, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Marriage, he plainly teaches us, That even the moſt Innocent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Pleaſures may ceaſe to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent in our manner of uſing them. As, If they engroſs our Hearts, and draw us off from better Thoughts and Practices; If they intrude upon our Spiritual Affairs, vitiate our Affections, and, in a word, grow to Exceſs, or prove Unſeaſonable. For, how reaſonable ſoever theſe Allegations appear'd to thoſe who made them here, and do no doubt ſtill, to Millions more that urge them daily; yet you ſee they found no favour with Almighty God. Theſe Men of Honeſt Buſineſs, and Innocent Delights, are notwithſtanding decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be unworthy; and all their Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, ſuppoſing them both real and important, could not, nor ever will acquit the Perſons, or bear out their refuſal to attend upon higher Duties. Theſe are the <hi>Bidden,</hi> the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngrateful Wretches,</hi> whom Chriſt rejects with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and not one of them is admitted
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:49873:169"/> to <hi>taſte of his Supper.</hi> Which brings me to the ſecond branch of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The Inſufficiency of thoſe Excuſes made for not complying with this Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> And This appears much more from the Thing deſigned by the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than it does by any expreſs words in the Parable it ſelf. There we are left to gather, that there was Reaſon good, why the Gueſts ſhould have preferred this Feaſt, before their own Worldly Advantages, and Delights But, in the Benefits of the Goſpel, Goodneſs and Truth in This, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the next, Life; the Obligation and Neceſſity of making theſe our firſt care, approves it ſelf to every common Underſtanding. As will ſoon appear, Whether the <hi>Perſon Inviting,</hi> the <hi>Feast it ſelf,</hi> or the <hi>Cauſes that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Man from attending it,</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Perſon Inviting us is God.</hi> And this alone is cauſe ſufficient why we ſhould come. In Humane Converſation we may make great Diſtinctions; and proportion our Reſpects according to the Quality, or the Friendſhip, of thoſe that ask our Company. With Them,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:49873:169"/> whom Birth or Fortune make our Equals, we can be bold, and uſe thoſe Liberties, which good Breeding will forbid to Them above us. And, if a mighty Prince, or kind Benefactor, a Patron and a Friend require our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, all our Affairs muſt be diſpenſed with; all Buſineſs and Diverſion laid aſide, to teſtify our Gratitude and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and nothing waited on but He. Shall we not then obey the Gracious Offer, when the Great King of Heaven, and Lord of Lords, vouchſafes to call us? He is our Beſt, our Only Friend; from Him we derive all our Comforts, all our Hopes, nay even our very Selves; He commands all our Love and Thanks, and He deſerves them all. To ſuffer other Objects to poſſeſs our Hearts, in Oppoſition to, or Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Him, is a fault; and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide our Affections is to rob him. Our Mind, our Soul, our Strength, the Whole of Theſe is his juſt Tribute; and thoſe Men are falſe, unthankful, and unjuſt, who put the trifles of a periſhing Life, into the balance with their God and Duty. For how reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoever our regards may be to theſe things, when conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:49873:170"/> and with relation to our preſent Conveniences; yet they loſe all their value, and ceaſe to be of any Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, when ſet againſt our Obedience to that Great King, this Gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, this kindeſt of all Friends. Would the Hungry and the Naked; think you, object, that Work and Begging muſt be followed, when ſent for by his Prince, allowed to tread his Courts, and eat at his Table? Yet ſuch and greater is the Diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Almighty God, and all the Sons of Men. The pooreſt Begger, and the meaneſt Slave, is leſs beneath the Majeſty of Monarchs, Than even thoſe Monarchs are below the Majeſty of God. Yet does this God invite, yet does He importune us, <hi>Such is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour all his Servants have.</hi> Well then may that great Maſter of the Feaſt be angry, when ſuch deny his favour, and put him off with vain pretences. He cannot but condemn them, and they, if they would reflect or think at all, muſt needs condemn their own folly, For (which is more) Theſe Calls are not to our Duty only, but to our Intereſt too; as will appear, if we now deſcend to conſider,</p>
            <pb n="323" facs="tcp:49873:170"/>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Nature of the Feaſt it ſelf, and what is figured by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When Men provide their dainty Meats, ſome weightier Matters may come in between, and hinder the paying our reſpects. And in ſuch caſe our loſs is not very conſiderable; A courſer Meal at home, inſtead of higher feeding, which Nature miſſes not, will ſerve the turn as well. But here the Feaſt is very Suſtenance and Life, the only Thing by which our Souls ſubſiſt; and They, who do not come hither, muſt look for nothing, but Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Death, Deſpair and Miſery. For our Condition lies in wide Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, it admits no middle State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Heaven and Hell; and they who do not <hi>eat Bread</hi> with Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels <hi>in the Kingdom of God;</hi> are caſt for ever into utter Darkneſs, and paſs infinite Ages in weeping and wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth; in Regions of Horror, and the diſmal Society of Fiends and Devils. When therefore this Proffer, mentioned in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is made to needy Man; when He is called to ſit and feed with God; The invitation is, to fill our Souls with all manner of Graces and Virtues now;
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:49873:171"/> and with all the fullneſs of Eternal Bliſs, when Death tranſlates them to another State. This is to ask them if they will be Happy; Happy beyond their deſert, beyond their comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, beyond their largeſt wiſhes and deſires. It is to call, to preſs them to it. And Who in his right mind will deny ſuch a proffer as this? Who can ſuppoſe, that Any engagement ought to obſtruct him in the purſuit of it? Who can excuſe ſo unreaſonable a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, I do not ſay, to God, but to His own ſelf? Moſt certain it is, All Men agree in this deſign, of being Happy. All ſeek the ſame End, though they ſeek it by different means. But 'tis as certain too, that He, who made Us, and our Happineſs, hath told us, That in <hi>His preſence alone is true Joy;</hi> and They who do not feek, They who do not accept it there, whatever ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons elſe they may find or fancy, all theſe will prove but flattering empty dreams at laſt; and <hi>good were it for ſuch men if they had never been born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Cauſes Parallel to thoſe aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Parable for keeping Men away, deſerve to be cloſely conſidered.</hi> For the Love of Riches, the Incumbrances of
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:49873:171"/> a worldly Life, and the Indulging of Senſual Delights, are of very fatal Conſequence to the Soul. It may be alledged indeed, in their vindication and excuſe, that the Parable ſuppoſes them to be only ſuch Cares, and ſuch Pleaſures, as in their own nature are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and unblameable. But yet this does not acquit thoſe of guilt who are too eager in the purſuit of them. For it is the part of a Good, as well as a Wiſe Man, to carry his Eye forward to the Conſequences of Things; And the Chriſtian Religion expects, that we ſhould no more addict our ſelves to thoſe Paſſions and Engagements, which are ſure to have ill effects upon us, than to thoſe that have an inherent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, and are downright vicious in themſelves. So that, although the Concerns of a Man's Calling, and the prudent contrivances of raiſing a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune fairly, though every gratification of our fleſhly Appetites, Every recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of the Mind, be not abſolutely forbidden; yet when they exceed in their Meaſures, when they get within us, and gain upon our Affections, when they looſen our Principles, and detain us from matters of a higher and more
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:49873:172"/> laſting Importance; they then become ſinful. And for this reaſon ought they to be uſed always with great Temper and Moderation, becauſe they are apt to betray us to theſe Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences. The Dangers riſing from them are not the leſs, but in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects greater, becauſe the Things are lawful. For of thoſe Men, who are not utterly abandoned to Wickedneſs and a Reprobate Mind, More, it is probable, periſh by the abuſe of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and Good things, than by the Love or the Commiſſion of things po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively Evil. In theſe the Offence ſoon manifeſts it ſelf; Here Reproof, Reaſon, and Remorſe of Conſcience, ſtrike in, and check an open breach of Duty; There needs not much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity to diſcern things palpably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; But where the Fact it ſelf, or the Object we are converſant about, does not fall under ſuch plain Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, there it is eaſie to miſtake in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and Degrees. For here Men neither have, nor can have, any certain Rule to guide them; The Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Buſineſs and Pleaſure are not to be ſixed, but vary daily; Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Conſtitution of the Perſon,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:49873:172"/> The Neceſſities of his Condition, The preſent face and juncture of Affairs, and a thouſand other unforeſeen Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies; So that more or leſs may be allowed, to One Perſon, or at One Time, or upon One Occaſion, than can to another. All the Direction this caſe is capable of, is only that we avoid Irregularity and Exceſs, but We are Judges ſtill of that Irregularity and Exceſs, for Chriſtian Prudence is the only thing that can determine it. And from hence proceeds the Hazard of ſuch actions, That Men are apt to be too partial to the ſide of the World and the Fleſh; They know theſe things are not directly ſinful, and This ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them in the love and practice of them; This gives them Confidence and great Security, and they are very hardly brought to acknowledge or to mend a fault, or to impoſe ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints in thoſe caſes, where God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a Liberty and Uſe of the thing in Queſtion. And beſides, Here the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities and Comforts of Life fall in, and add freſh force to the Argument. Eaſe, and Subſiſtence, and the Care of Families, when ſeconded and urg'd by Inclination, find it an eaſie matter
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:49873:173"/> to influence the Reaſon, and over-beat Religion too in time. Men know and own, that God is to be ſerved; but the ſame God, they tell you, hath ſo ordained, that their Neceſſities and Conveniences ſhould be ſerved too; And therefore He (they hope) will not forget, that they obey him even in theſe cares; and cannot take it ill, if their attendance upon his Will in the Conſtitutions of his Providence, ſhould interfere now and then with their obſervance of his Laws and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; For both they cannot do; They wiſh with all their hearts they could; but they truſt they ſerve him very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably even in what they do.</p>
            <p>Such are the vain pretences, which worldly-minded People make, to cover that neglect of God, which they are aſhamed to confeſs; and to ruine their own Souls by deceitful colours of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and lawful Practices. But pray my Friends Conſider; God ſets us in the World; and, for our humiliation, hath appointed us a life of Trouble and Induſtry, and Labour. By Theſe he gives leave, nay he commands, that we ſhould provide for our ſelves, and thoſe that depend upon us; But
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:49873:173"/> he does not mean that this ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo far, as to ſhut out Him, from our Regard and our Thoughts. We are to uſe, but we are not to ſerve the World. God gave Man large Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and made him Lord of the Creatures here below. But when our hopes, our labours, and our delights, are placed upon theſe objects; we then degrade our ſelves, loſe our Original Prerogative, and that Dominion turns to Slavery. We ſhould enjoy the Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, and love the Giver, but we muſt not ſlight the Giver; and dote upon the Gift. We muſt employ ſome time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Buſineſs; A greater or leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time according as our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs happens; But Body and Eſtate muſt not ſwallow the Soul; The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of a moment muſt not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to Eternity; Nor may we ever follow the World ſo cloſe, as not to be at leiſure to be ſaved. This may take up Some of our Love and our Thoughts, but God muſt always reign, and ſit Supreme, in all our Thoughts and Endeavours, and Affections. And therefore mighty caution and reſerve is neceſſary in this matter of Worldly cares, becauſe the Preſent is exceeding
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:49873:174"/> apt to engroſs us, and we know who hath told us, that <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. VI. 24.</note> 
               <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mammon cannot both be ſerved.</hi> In ſhort, All we do, and All we ſeek here below, muſt be in ſubordination to ſomewhat nobler and better above; and ſhould never be permitted to juſtle out our firſt and great Concern, <hi>Gods Righteouſneſs and Kingdom.</hi> When this Great Maſter of the Feaſt invites us, we muſt leave all, and follow Him; prefer His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion before our Own, and readily obey the gracious Summons. Heaven and our Souls require the beſt of our Care; And, believe me, it is not a little care that will ſuffice for theſe purpoſes. Our Paſſions muſt be mortified; our Deſires reſigned; our Affections raiſed and fixed upon a better Country. And this is a work that will ask more of our time and pains, than men ſeem gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally well aware of. Let any of us but make the Experiment; Let a man ſingle out One darling Luſt, and ſee how many conflicts, how long pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice it will coſt him, perfectly to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due That One. And this will ſoon convince him, how unreaſonable it is, to think Salvation a Work by the by; and how unworthy they
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:49873:174"/> are of Eternal happineſs, who will afford no time for Religion, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which hangs upon their hands; How impudent a thing it is to ſerve God, only when we have nothing elſe to do; How unequally thoſe Men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves, who ſpend ſo much upon the World, and ſo little upon Heaven; who pretend periſhing Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and Engagements, and involve themſelves in endleſs Purſuits and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, about the leſs, the trifling advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; and leave no time for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more ſubſtantial. This is our Caſe, and This is our Danger, when even the moſt Lawful cares employ us; That they ſteal away our Hearts, and take poſſeſſion; debaſe our Minds, and faſten them down to the Earth, devour our time and ſtrength, and leave us no Leiſure, no Inclination, to follow that which is the great End of Living, the Glory of God, and the Salvation of our Souls. They harden us againſt the <hi>Calls</hi> of Grace, and indulge and feed thoſe very Luſts, which we are bound to kill and crucify. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince when God permits the One ſort of theſe cares, he does not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve us from the Other; Since he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:49873:175"/> us to Another State, and hath given us a double Care; to provide for our living hereafter, as well as here, but chiefly to provide how we may live hereafter; And, ſince that future Life is to be ſought, by fervent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, by conſtant Watchfulneſs, by painful Labour of the mind, by many repeated Acts of Self-denial and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; Since Vertue and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are not to be attained in an inſtant, but muſt be the fruit of a long Courſe and continual Endeavours; Since the Rewards of theſe are ſo much more precious and deſirable, and the Reſt at our Journeys end ſo much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, than any Conveniences we can poſſibly meet with by the Way; It follows, that theſe Conveniences muſt be uſed and ſought, but as Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only, as things given to ſupport and entertain us in our Travels. But if we be diverted by Theſe, and ſet up our reſt on this ſide the <hi>Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> The End of all will be to periſh in our folly; And when, inſtead of thanking Him by our Obedience, who gives us theſe Encouragements, we grow fond of Them, and deſpiſe Him; What can we think all this will come
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:49873:175"/> to at laſt, but that God ſhould be Juſt, and ſuch men Miſerable? That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge this baſeneſs of Wretches ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of their own true happineſs, ſo unthankful for his gracious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſions in their favour. In a word, that the fooliſh Worldling, who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſe to feed on Husks with Swine, ſhould be ſhut out as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to eat Bread <hi>in the Kingdom of his Heavenly Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>From the</hi> Juſtice <hi>of God in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, Wretches ſo unperſwadeable to their own Advantage,</hi> I paſs now, in the <hi>Second</hi> place, <hi>To conſider his</hi> Mercy <hi>in the means uſed for the Converſion of thoſe, who do thankfully accept and profit under them.</hi> And This, as it is illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated throughout the whole Parable, ſo particularly in the twenty third Verſe now before us, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto the Servant, Go out into the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways and Hedges, and compel them to come in, that my houſe may be filled.</hi> That even the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould find ſo much favour was wonderfully kind, but of That large Intimations and Promiſes had been given in the Old Teſtament. But that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who were under the ſame formal
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:49873:176"/> Covenant with God; That the <hi>Blind</hi> and the <hi>Lame,</hi> the Wanderers and Stragglers ſhould be ſo earneſtly invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo gladly received, this is a moſt ſurpriſing, a moſt unſpeakable Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion. It was ſo in the firſt Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Goſpel, it is ſo in the conſtant miniſtration of it ſtill. For, even in Chriſtian Countries, there want not inſtances too many, of Men, whoſe Spiritual Infirmities render them as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, as deſpicable in that Capacity, as their Outward and Bodily ones do thoſe wretched Objects, that lie at our Doors, and in our Streets. The Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and the Irreſolute, the Men of Weak Reaſon and Strong Paſſions, Theſe are the <hi>blind,</hi> and the <hi>halt,</hi> and the <hi>maimed;</hi> And They who live wild, and ſubmit to no Rule, no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, are as properly the <hi>High-ways</hi> and <hi>Hedges,</hi> as the darkeſt and moſt barbarous Nations heretofore. Yet even theſe our God does not deſpiſe, but gathers them up and feeds them, when they are duly ſenſible of their Miſery, humble and poor in Spirit, and ſadly ſorry for their Imperfections. Thus, while They, whoſe Hearts and Circumſtances are at Eaſe, grow inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:49873:176"/> and diſdain his Mercy, and theſe conceited rich are ſent empty away; The hungry Soul feeds, and fills it ſelf with good things. The Perſons then, to whom ſuch favour is ſhewn, make it the more remarkable; Eſpecially when ſo much Induſtry is uſed upon their account as this whole Parable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects; And We, if we reflect upon the wiſe methods of God, may find.</p>
            <p>Now this care I ſpeak of, was ſeen heretofore, in the many repeated Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and Calls to <hi>Knowledge and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;</hi> In God's being found of thoſe that fought him not, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting himſelf to Them, who neither were, nor cared to be, acquainted with him. But chiefly in ſending that Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Servant, <hi>Him in whom his Soul delighted,</hi> Him, <hi>who took upon him the form of a Servant,</hi> and ſtoop'd to all the meanneſſes and ſufferings of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted fleſh, to collect theſe miſerable and impotent Creatures into his Houſe, and unite theſe Vagabonds into one Family. Nor does there want great and wiſe Variety of Means to reduce lame and infirm Chriſtians ſtill; tho' neither the Caſe, nor the manner of the Remedy now, do either require, or
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:49873:177"/> admit, an exact Parallel. The recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Men early into Chriſt's Fold, and preventing the Powers of Hell, and Misfortunes of Error, by the timely Sanctifications of Baptiſm, and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of being Educated in the Truth; The daily Adminiſtration of the Word and Sacraments, which are ſo many <hi>Calls</hi> loudly ſounding in our Ears; The Inward Influences of the Divine Grace, driving thoſe <hi>Calls</hi> home, and making them enter deep, and work Effectually; Theſe are ſtanding Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods; and with Theſe Applications all Ingenuous Tempers will be won. But if Some prove Refractory and Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, God does not give them over even ſo. For then is the Seaſon of <hi>compelling them to come in,</hi> that is, Of betaking himſelf to ſome more ſharp, and powerful, and awakening me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods; Such as ſhall in a manner force and drive them to better Conſideration, ſuch as there is no ſtanding out againſt, but will work upon Men's minds, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt whether they will or no. Of this kind are thoſe Seaſonable Pains, or Fits of Sickneſs upon our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; Thoſe Afflictions in our Eſtates, Thoſe Loſſes of our Relations, The
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:49873:177"/> Aſperſions upon our good Names, by which the Stubborn themſelves are bound to diſcipline, the Proud are humbled, the Careleſs are rouzed into Thought, and the Bold daring Sinner is affrighted into better manners. For the natural Effect of theſe things is to teach men Underſtanding, and the End of all Correction from our Heavenly Father, is to make the chaſtiſed parties <note n="*" place="margin">Hebr. XII. 10.</note> 
               <hi>partakers of his holineſs;</hi> to reclaim them from thoſe Offences that have deſerved his Judgments, and to bring forth the wholſome and <hi>profitable fruits</hi> of Peace, and Patience, and Amendment.</p>
            <p>Oh Bleſt conſtraint! Oh kind ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity! Lord give us Grace, when this thy bitter Cup is held forth to us, not with Patience only, but even with Thanks to drink it; and wiſely to conſider, that what it wants in Reliſh, it makes up in Health and kindly Operation. Help us, not to bear only, but to kiſs the Rod; and bleſs thoſe Sufferings that force us to be happy. Lord! when thy Gentler methods have been uſed to no effect, permit us not to periſh for want of ſtrong unpalatable remedies; but when we wander and grow wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton with proſperity, ſtop thou our
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:49873:178"/> wicked and unwary ſteps, pluck us back from the dangerous precipice, and let us not be utterly loſt; but, by diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and misfortunes ſent for our Eternal welfare, bend our Head-ſtrong Hearts, ſubdue and ſoften our rebellious Paſſions, and thus at leaſt <hi>compel us to come in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall take leave now to conclude this Argument concerning Mens neglect of Religion in general, by applying the Parable before us, as our excellent <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Commun. Service. Second Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort.</hi>
               </note> Church hath done, (and as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice of many careleſs Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans gives but too juſt occaſion for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) to their making Buſineſs and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions an excuſe, for not frequenting the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Lord's Supper in particular. This is a great and moſt neceſſary part of the Chriſtian Inſtitution; it is enforced by all thoſe Reaſons urged at large in the foregoing parts of this Diſcourſe; But, becauſe ſomething may be obſerved with regard to it, more peculiar to the Dignity of the Myſtery, and more accommodated to ſtir and warm our Affections, I would not content my ſelf with referring you to thoſe general Conſiderations only.</p>
            <pb n="339" facs="tcp:49873:178"/>
            <p>Conſider then, my Brethren, that Your God and Saviour hath here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a noble and moſt delicious Feaſt. He ſpreads his Table, ſends out his Servants and Inviters, and asks your Company to eat; to eat not only with him, but of him. Himſelf is here the Maſter, and himſelf is the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Fowls upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and the Beaſts of the Field are all in his ſight; yet were all theſe ſlain and ſerved up, the Feaſt would not be ſo rich as now it is. For here the Soul is fed, and Heaven it ſelf deſcends My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically into every faithful Breaſt. The Lamb of God is kill'd and crucified: You ſee the Images of his Body brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and broken, and the Blood ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his Wounded Side. And with theſe Elements of Bread and Wine each faithful Gueſt receives an inward Grace: Pardon &amp; Peace, ſpiritual Strength and every benefit of his ſaving Paſſion. Hence 'tis theſe Elements are term'd the <hi>Bread of Life,</hi> the <hi>Wine of Elect Souls,</hi> and in a ſpiritual and efficacious ſenſe, <hi>the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> which nouriſhes and exhilarates the inward Man, and conveys into us a principle of living godlily, and living for ever.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:49873:179"/> And are you ſo ſtupid, to prefer the <hi>Apples of Sodom,</hi> and the <hi>Grapes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi> before this Heavenly Banquet? Do the fading, the empty objects of the preſent time ſo wholly imploy you, that no leiſure can be found for the Concerns of Eternity? Shall ſinful Delights; nay, ſhall important Affairs draw you off? What is this, but to indulge your Bodies, or to feed your Families, while ſomething, nearer to you than both theſe, is ſuffered to lye and periſh for Hunger, without any ſeeming Concern?</p>
            <p>But farther yet. Remember who it is that invites you. Your Father, your Friend, your King, your God. And is there no reſpect due to theſe Characters? It is your Chriſt that calls; he who hungered, and thirſted, and wept, and bled, and dy'd for you. He calls you to that health and happineſs, which you could never have had, unleſs he had in mercy condeſcended to do and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all this for you.</p>
            <p>He earneſtly intreats you in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to accept the pledges of his future, and the tokens of his paſt Love; to ſtrengthen your Faith in the One, by theſe lively remembrances
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:49873:179"/> of the Other: And not refuſe to be found by one, who hath taken ſo much pains to ſeek and to ſave you, when you were loſt. How can you then ſo rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo unworthily abſent your ſelves? How unpardonable is this Coldneſs, this Refuſal, this Contempt of ſo great a Myſtery, and your own Mercy? Is this a ſuitable return for ſo much Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? And would you forgive your ſelves for uſing any Patron upon Earth ſo ungratefully? But you want no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, if Buſineſs and troubleſome Engagements would permit you to come. Alas! vain Man! Your <hi>Fields and Yoke of Oxen,</hi> the following your Employment, and providing for your Children will not diſcharge you from attending here. If theſe things ought to be done, yet the other ought leaſt of all to be left undone. Nor hath God ſo ordered the matter, but that Both may very well be done, and each, in their due place, will be highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him. But if our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were truly conſidered, this is the much more neceſſary. For hither we come to find Cure for our Sins, Food for our inward Strength, Comfort for our Sorrows, a Sanctified uſe of our
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:49873:180"/> Enjoyments, a Bleſſing upon our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Labours, and, which is more worth than all the reſt, a Fore-taſt of Heavenly Bliſs, in peace of Conſcience, pure Devotion, and an intimate Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with our dear Redeemer. Theſe are the Benefits of worthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, and They who will conſent to be thus happy here, ſhall by theſe means be happy for ever hereafter.</p>
            <p>Do not then turn the deaf Ear to ſo kind, ſo advantagious offers; nor let Gods empty Tables any more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach you: Defraud not thus your Souls, whoſe dangerous Sickneſs is want of Appetite to this Spiritual Food. And that Inappetence is cauſed by too long abſtinence. Frequent and devour approaches will quicken your deſires, will heal your diſtempers, will refreſh all your Languiſhings. And, believe me, it highly concerns you, to make up for paſt neglects, while you have time: For fear theſe precious opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities riſe up in Judgment, and draw on that Sentence of my Text, That <hi>They who will not taſte this Supper here,</hi> ſhall not be ſuffered to partake in Heaven, of That which this repreſents, even the Glorious Preſence of the King
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:49873:180"/> of Saints, the Company of Angels and Bleſſed Spirits, the everlaſting Feſtival of the Faithful, and the Marriage Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lamb of God. Which Condemnation God give us all Grace to eſcape, <hi>for the ſake of that Lamb, the bleſſed Holy Jeſus, who takes away the ſin of the World, and to whom, with God the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt be all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>WHILE our Saviour was diſcovering his Glory to ſome of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in his Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on the Mount; a Perſon, in grief for his Son, who was grievouſly
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:49873:181"/> vexed with a Devil, brings him to the remainder of thoſe Diſciples left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, to have the evil Spirit diſpoſſeſt. Providence in great Wiſdom had ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the matter, that They were not able to effect this Cure, which gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the Scribes to attack them; And in the Heat of that Diſpute our Saviour returns, <note n="*" place="margin">Verſ. 1. <hi>to</hi> 14.</note> to inquire into the Cauſe of their Controverſy; <note n="†" place="margin">Ver. 16.</note> and is anſwered by the Party concerned, that he had made Tryal of the Diſciples in Vain; which gave him ſome diſtruſt of their Maſter too. For ſo it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it had, by that doubtful form, in which he begs his aſſiſtance, (<hi>V.</hi> 22.) <hi>But if thou canſt do any thing, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on us, and help us.</hi> Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hereupon gives him to underſtand, that even the Power of working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles was under ſome confinements; and not to be exerted, except in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſuch Perſons as met it with a ready Faith: But where it found Men duly qualify'd, nothing was or ſhould be wanting on God's part; <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him, If thou canſt believe, all things are poſſible to him that believeth,</hi> (V. 23.) The Father of the Child, full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for his Son, ſadly ſenſible of his
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:49873:182"/> own Defects, and deſirous of greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, replies with a very moving ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, and an over-flowing of Tears, <hi>Lord I believe, help thou my unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This manner of Addreſs plainly ſpeaks the State of the Man's Mind, and ſhews he wanted a full and abſolute perſwaſion, and ſuch an entire confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Power and Goodneſs of Chriſt, as he wiſhed and ought to have had: Nay ſuch as we find ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of, in the Hiſtory of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Life and Actions. But, though he had not all Faith, yet it ſeems he had Enough for his purpoſe. He did not come up to the higheſt, and foremoſt Rank; but he was accepted, and thought worthy of Compaſſion, though not of Commendation. Accordingly the following Verſes declare the ſucceſs of this imperfect condition of Soul; for our Lord commanded the dumb and deaf Spirit, and wrought the Cure, though with ſome pain and difficulty to the Patient. A difficulty which ſeems to have born proportion to the Father's Faith; <note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 26.</note> For <hi>the Spirit cried and rent him ſore, and he was as one dead.</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Command was too mighty to be diſobey'd, for <hi>the Spirit came out of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:49873:182"/> him,</hi> and as St. <hi>Matthew adds,</hi> in his relation of this Paſſage, <hi>the Child was cured from that very Hour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My deſign from hence is to apply this inſtance at large, by enquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nature of a Weak and Imperfect Faith, and that chiefly for theſe two Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the Humiliation of thoſe who imagine themſelves more perfect than really they are.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> for the Comfort of Them, who are in reality Better men than they imagine themſelves to be. And I do not doubt, before I have done, but to convince the moſt exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtian, that though he may truly ſay, with this perſon in my Text, <hi>Lord I believe;</hi> yet there is need enough ſtill of joyning in the latter part of the Verſe, and of praying as he did, <hi>Lord help my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> And I hope too, that what I ſhall ſay will be able to ſupport the honeſt and the feeble-minded Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that though they are ſadly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>ſome remains of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> in their Souls, which need to be helped; yet the Caſe is not ſo bad with them neither, but that they may without Vanity
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:49873:183"/> that Profeſſion, in the beginning of my Text, and ſay very truly, <hi>Lord I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is my intention; but the nature of the Subject will not ſo well bear to have the Argument branched out to theſe Two different ſorts of Perſons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly. For the ſame Reaſons, which prove that No man arrives at an abſolute Perfection in Faith, do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe prove, That No man ought to deſpair, becauſe he diſcovers ſome Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Faith in himſelf. Since at that rate Every ones Circumſtances would be deſperate; and there could be no ſuch thing as a worthy and true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the World. I muſt therefore content my ſelf with handling this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the General; and that, which ſeems to me at preſent the beſt method for doing it effectually, is to inſiſt on theſe Three Heads.
<list>
                  <item>I. Firſt, <hi>To aſſign ſome reaſons for the weakneſs of mens Faith.</hi> And theſe ſhall be ſuch, as every one of us will find himſelf more or leſs concerned in.</item>
                  <item>II. Secondly, <hi>To ſhew, that thoſe things which Many People are apt to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:49873:183"/> as ſigns of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, or that they have not True Faith, are not in reality any ſuch Signs.</hi> And</item>
                  <item>III. Thirdly, <hi>To lay down ſome Rules, whereby the weakneſs of Faith may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from the Want of it.</hi> And here I will ſhew how any man, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining his own Conſcience carefully, may diſcern whether his Belief be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Terms of Salvation, or not.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the 1ſt, And here by <hi>Faith</hi> I underſtand not only (1.) <hi>The Aſſent of the mind</hi> to thoſe Truths which God hath revealed, in obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and dependence on his Truth and Goodneſs; Nor barely (2.) <hi>An outward and expreſs'd Profeſſion</hi> of all ſuch Articles, are neceſſary to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in order to make us Chriſtians; but alſo (3.) <hi>Such a vigorous and lively Aſſent, as may prevail upon men to enter into Covenant with God, and may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence their Hearts and Practice power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> ſuch as may put us upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of our Duty, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good thoſe Engagements in the whole Courſe of our Lives, which we bring upon our ſelves, when we thus enter
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:49873:184"/> Covenant with God. For All This is comprehended under <hi>Believing;</hi> and ſeveral accounts may be given of our failing in ſundry inſtances of this Faith. Particularly Theſe that follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As <hi>Firſt,</hi> One reaſon of this may be taken from the very <hi>Nature of thoſe things, which we are commanded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> For Some of theſe being very dark and myſterious Truths, it cannot be expected, that our Minds ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to them, with the ſame ſort of Aſſurance, that they are uſed to do, in ſuch Other matters as fall within our Comprehenſion, and of which we have a clearer and more diſtinct knowledge. The Attributes and Excellencies of God; the Trinity of Perſons in the Divine Nature; an Eternal State of Bliſs or Woe hereafter; and the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to us theſe fleſhly Bodies again at the General Reſurrection, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the infinite and unconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Changes which Time and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bring upon them in the mean while) Theſe, and ſome Others of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are of the firſt Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; the Prime and moſt neceſſary Truths to be entertained, and firmly
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:49873:184"/> embraced. But it is manifeſt withal, that Theſe are matters, of which one cannot have any juſt and adequate No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Becauſe they are not commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to the Capacities of mortal men. The largeſt mind is too narrow to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them; the moſt penetrating Wit cannot ſound all their depths; nor the moſt indefatigable Study conquer all the difficulties that may be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. And therefore, ſince Men's Aſſent is always governed by their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, the Mind will never find the ſame Evidence for thoſe things that are far above out of our ſight, that it does for Others, which we ſee, and feel, and daily converſe with; Such as are of the ſame level with our ſelves, and we are able to give a tolerable good account of, by our own ſerious Thought, and nice Enquiry into the Nature of them.</p>
            <p>I do not mean by this, that we have not Sufficient Motives for our Belief, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of thoſe Truths, which we are leaſt able to comprehend. For, when we are once perſwaded of the Being of a God; and convinced, that theſe are His Revelations; nothing can be more equitable, than to ſubmit our own
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:49873:185"/> Reaſoning to his Declarations. This ſingle Reflection, that infinite Wiſdom cannot be miſtaken, that Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot lead others into miſtakes, nor perfect Truth lye, is a foundation ſtrong enough to Build the firmeſt Faith upon. But ſtill the urging of this Reflection upon our ſelves muſt be the work of much application. And, though we are exceedingly to blame, if any Objections, which the Obſcurity of thoſe Great Important Doctrins is wont to raiſe in us, be ſuffered to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw our Faith, or dangerouſly to ſhake it; yet ſuch is the nature of our minds, that where Senſe or Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do not repreſent things to us plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and beyond all Contradiction, there Scruples and Cavils will now and then ariſe; and the Devil will not fail to make uſe of theſe Occaſions, and try by them to looſen and diſſettle us, from that firmneſs of perſwaſion, which is due to ſuch a Revelation. Even They, who ſtruggle moſt ſucceſsfully againſt ſuch attempts of his, may yet ſometimes find a tendency to doubt, or ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſturbance from them.</p>
            <p>But thoſe men will be ſure to find a very great deal, who, over-looking the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:49873:185"/> of the Teſtimony and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf, which is Reaſon's proper Province in theſe matters; they expect their ſatisfaction from the ſight and knowledge of the things Revealed. Which is in effect to put their Enquiry upon a wrong Scent, to require an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, of which the Condition of this Subject is not capable, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the very Eſſence of Faith: which in ſtrict ſpeaking could not be <hi>Faith,</hi> if it were not the <hi>Evidence of things unſeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if ſuch be the Condition of our Faith, with regard to the very <hi>first</hi> Act; That of <hi>Aſſenting to the Truths revealed by God:</hi> We ſhall find the Difficulties grow upon us in the following parts of it, when it comes to influence our Practice, and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our Affections. And this will appear very evidently, if we conſider</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Secondly,</hi> After what manner it is, that the Belief of theſe Truths come to gain a power over our Wills, and to command our Actions. One would think, that, to be once through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced of the Truth of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and the Reaſonableneſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:49873:186"/> of the Duties it enjoins, were enough to fix a Man all his Life long. And perhaps, in matters of mere Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation it is ſo. After any point hath been duly conſidered, and all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for and againſt it have been put into the Balance together; That ſide which preponderates will take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Underſtanding. And, if the advantage be viſible and great, there will be no probable danger of having this undone again, or being drawn off to a contrary Opinion. But where we are not to reſt in a bare Judgment, of a thing's being <hi>thus,</hi> or <hi>otherwiſe;</hi> Where we are obliged to purſue a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o' all its Conſequences, and to make it a Rule of Living to us; Where we muſt not only believe that ſo it is, but upon all occaſions behave our ſelves like Men ſeriouſly poſſeſt with that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; there the Caſe is very different. And from hence it is, that no preſent perſwaſion, though never ſo full, and clear, will anſwer the Character of a Chriſtian Faith, without a particular and conſtant Application. And in this it ſeems to be chiefly, that the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Chriſtians fail: And great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties there are, both in reducing
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:49873:186"/> General acknowledged Truths to our own Particular Circumſtances; and in having the Applications always ready and at hand, when our occaſions call for them.</p>
            <p>This is manifeſtly ſeen in the very firſt principle of all Religion, <hi>The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a God and Providence.</hi> For the acknowledgment of ſuch a Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fors a Power conſtantly ſuperintending the Affairs of the whole World; Ever preſent with us; A ſtrict Obſerver, and an impartial Judge of all our Actions; A Lover of Holineſs and Juſtice, and a mighty Avenger of his Honour, when we provoke him. Theſe are all of them Notions, which either Nature, or Religion, or Both, have riveted ſo faſt into men's Minds, that we find ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Few of thoſe who ſtrive againſt them, and would fain get quit of them, able to do it effectually.</p>
            <p>And yet of the Men who profeſs to have theſe Apprehenſions, how few are there, that take a due care to drive them home, upon their Conſciences, and improve them to all the mighty purpoſes, which they are fitted to ſerve? Nay, How often do even They, who revolve them frequently, and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:49873:187"/> make it their buſineſs to dwell and converſe with their Lord; How often, I ſay, do They, the Beſt, the moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent Adorers of the Godhead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray their want of Conſideration, and fall, by Surpriſe or Forgetfulneſs, if not by Wilfulneſs and Preſumption? Now the failings of moſt People in this Caſe, cannot proceed from Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or want of Faith, properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; for they do moſt firmly believe the Juſtice, and Providence of God; And are able, perhaps, in cold Blood, to convince the ſturdieſt Gainſayer, and to warm the coldeſt and moſt fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Neglecter of Religion.</p>
            <p>But the buſineſs is, that their thoughts are not always equally bent, nor the Applications of theſe general Doctrines at all times made to their own private Circumſtances; Or even thoſe Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are not ever powerful alike: And, becauſe the <hi>ſhewing our Faith by our Works,</hi> is a duty of continual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and uſe; and not One ſingle Act of Perſwaſion and Aſſent, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſtedfaſt; Therefore every one, in this reſpect, is more or leſs defective, as he is wanting in the ready perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of each Act. And even thoſe
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:49873:187"/> who would be ready to dye at a ſtake for the Truth of Chriſtianity, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not always preſerve their Minds ſo throughly awake, nor find the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of theſe things ſo lively and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, as to prevent, in their lives, Every thing that is not perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ſuch a Belief. The Habit of Faith is in their Souls, and in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, perhaps in Moſt Occaſions, exerts it ſelf with great efficacy, and ſucceſs. But it is their misfortune, that the Cares of the World, The Clutter of buſineſs, The Diverſions of Life, Their own Inadvertency, or ſome other accidental Unhappineſs, juſtle the more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Meditations aſide for a while, and ſo that Habit lies dormant and idle. It will probably recover and rouſe it ſelf very quickly, but, till that be done, it is the ſame thing, (as to that particular inſtant of action) as if the man had had no ſuch <hi>Ideas</hi> at all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is yet another Account to be given of Men's weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith, in which all of us are deeply; All (God knows) but too deeply concerned, I mean the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Humane Nature, with regard
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:49873:188"/> to the prevalency of our carnal Luſts, and the Affection we bear to this preſent World. The former Particular ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us a defect owing to want of Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; but This goes farther, &amp; diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a failing even in Conſideration it ſelf. When we pretend to judge, and yet determine wrong; When we do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our Duty, &amp; think upon it, but think and remember without Succeſs. And This is a failing of ſo much the more fatalcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, becauſe Perſons of higher Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection are Subject to it. For, that the Heedleſs and Heady ſhould ſtumble and fall, can be no ſtrange thing to us, But when the Cautious and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, They who are ſenſible of the Slippery way, and ſee their danger, and intend to avoid the Precipice, do yet ſlide into it; This muſt in all reaſon make us very apprehenſive, and will warrant no Man in any vain ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of abſolute Security and Perfection.</p>
            <p>The Powers of Reaſon and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are given us, to check and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul the extravagance of our Deſires; to calm and quiet our Paſſions; to comfort and ſuſtain us in all our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and Misfortunes. And indeed, if applied ſeaſonably and impartially,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:49873:188"/> they are ſufficient for this great Work; An excellent Remedy for all our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and a ſure Support under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt Calamities of humane Life. But yet this Remedy does not always prove effectual; becauſe we do many times fail in the Uſe of it, and will not allow it to have its full force, and juſt operation upon our Hearts, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline too much to the Objects of ſenſe, and are carried away by too tender a Concern for the things of this preſent World.</p>
            <p>We know well enough, that the Happineſs of a Chriſtian is not placed here below: And, when the precious Promiſes of the Goſpel are duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; when a Life of Eternity, and uninterrupted Bliſs is put into the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, againſt One, which we are ſure can be but ſhort, and find to be uneaſy and vexatious at the beſt; We cannot but be ſatisfied, that the Apoſtle had reaſon, in adviſing Men, by His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to look not <hi>at</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. IV. 18.</note> 
               <hi>the things which are ſeen and are temporal, but at the things that are not ſeen, becauſe they are Eternal.</hi> And yet, when we have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt this Truth pretty well, (as we think) upon our Souls; it frequently,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:49873:189"/> either forſakes us quite, when we come to the Encounter; or proves too feeble, when we have moſt occaſion for it. The Byaſs of Senſe draws us from our ſtrait Courſe; Some trifling Advantage, ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Gratification preſents it ſelf; and, though we pretend to argue, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the matter, yet it is too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but like a Corrupt Judge; All Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt inclination are leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the view; The Bribery upon our affections is too tempting to be withſtood; and we prevail with our ſelves againſt Duty and ſober Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to ſwallow the Bait, though at the ſame time we cannot but know, that there is Death upon the Hook. This is the Caſe of thoſe infinite Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are not early reflected upon with Remorſe, when paſt; but are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven committed with Reluctancy, at the very moment of Compliance. And the great Cauſe, why our After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remembrances of theſe things are ſo bitter to us, is, that then the Charm is at an End. We behold the Sin as it really is, and view it coolly; Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had magnified it to our Eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; And we ſaw every thing dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:49873:189"/> while drunk with Deſire and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But now that Diſguiſe is off, we have recovered our Senſes; and the thing is returned to its true proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons again. And thus we know, and perceive the Better, and yet chooſe and purſue the Worſe: And the Conflict St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to deſcribe in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate Perſon, happens ſometimes to be the Infelicity of a very good one, for the main: <note n="*" place="margin">Romans VIII. <hi>v.</hi> 19. 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>The good that I would I do not, but the evil that I would not, that I do.

            </p>
            <p>The Condition is much the ſame with our Griefs, and our Fears, and our Troubles, as it is with our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and Deſires. For, when we ſee a Friend in Poverty or Affliction, How many are there, that can addreſs themſelves to his Circumſtances with great Dexterity and Strength of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Tell him, that he muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf always under the diſpoſal of a Wiſe, and Juſt, and Kind Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that <hi>does not afflict willingly,</hi> nor

               <hi>for Good to them that Love and Fear God,</hi> and continue ſtedfaſt in their Duty; And that the <note n="†" place="margin">2 Cor. IV. 17.</note> 
               <hi>light ſufferings</hi> of a <hi>moment,</hi> if meekly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, and wiſely improved, will work out <hi>a far more exceeding and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal weight of Glory.</hi> Theſe, and ſuch like Conſolations are frequently incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with great Sincerity and Zeal. We utter them, not formally, and as Words of Courſe, but as the real Senſe of our own Souls. We wonder to ſee ſo ſmall effect of them; and are apt perhaps to make invidious Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons between our Selves and Others; as being fully perſwaded, that theſe Conſiderations would not fail to ſoften any Accident, and compoſe Our Minds under the ſevereſt Tryals, that our Patience could poſſibly be called to. But alas! Providence often undeceives us in this vain Opinion. For, if the like Misfortunes come to touch Us too,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:49873:190"/> all our former Wonder and Contempt ceaſes, and we preſently find our ſelves <hi>to be but Men.</hi> When a devouring Fire hath conſumed our Subſtance in a Moment, or the Anguiſh of Pain, and Bodily Diſeaſes, caſt us upon Beds of Languiſhing and Sorrow; Or if the Deſire of our Eyes be taken from us with a ſtroke; a tender Wife, a dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Child, or a Friend that is even as our own Soul, ſnatched out of our Arms; Nature then gets uppermoſt, and Paſſion makes head: We ſoon find a vaſt difference between talking like Philoſophers, and acting like them; and ſeem to take it ill, that our Friends ſhould think we ought to admit of ſuch cold Comforts, or put our grief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch Reſtraints, as we condemned others for neglecting, in the very ſame, or perhaps (if truly conſidered) in a more deplorable Caſe before, than Ours is now: I ſay, <hi>if truly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Becauſe in all theſe Caſes the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy of <hi>Self</hi> leads us into groſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, and is the only ground of all this change in us. For every Man is ſo partial, or ſo cruel to himſelf, as to fancy or find out ſome peculiar ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations in his Own Misfortunes,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:49873:191"/> which thoſe of No other Perſons in the World beſides, (he thinks) are, or can be attended with. And All this for no manner of Reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Theſe are his Own, and Thoſe are other Peoples. 'Tis the having no concern nor Intereſt in them, that ſhews him the Diſaſters of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in a juſt light, and leaves his Mind free and undiſturbed, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the ſuitableneſs of proper comforts to them. But in thoſe that come home to himſelf, Intereſt, and Paſſion, and Self-Love turn the Glaſs, and ſhew him every thing through falſe Opticks. The Affliction ſwells to a monſtrous bulk, and the Comforts dwindle away to nothing; till the black Cloud and Tempeſt be a little laid within; and the Man reſtored to Temper, and the power of thinking by Degrees.</p>
            <p>Religion and Prudence do indeed aſſiſt Men wonderfully, in giving Law to their Paſſions, reſtraining their Exceſſes, and preſerving them from all ſuch furious Heats, as are impious and indecent. But they do not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Humane Nature, nor prevent many ſudden Sallies, which a good Man in his ſoberer thoughts may ſee
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:49873:191"/> reaſon enough to condemn in himſelf. It is <note n="*" place="margin">1 John V. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Faith</hi> indeed, which <hi>overcometh the World;</hi> and <hi>This is the</hi> only <hi>Victory</hi> we can obtain over it. But it is very well, if we gain the Field at laſt, though after many fruitleſs Attempts, and with ſome Loſs. For, while we continue to live in theſe Bodies, They, and their Concerns, will affect us very tenderly; We muſt be content, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to act in them, but by them, and with them; nay, and to be acted upon by them too. And, unleſs Good men could wholly put off this load of Fleſh, and refine themſelves into Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, That will be dragging down the Soul, and tainting it, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, with its Affections. And Good men muſt either ceaſe to be Men, or it will never be otherwiſe with them.</p>
            <p>Thus far then we have advanced in the deſign I at firſt propounded; that Theſe Reaſons, aſſigned for the weakneſs of Faith, concern Every Man; As being founded partly in the Nature of Religion, and partly in the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Mankind. And therefore, Since no Man's Underſtanding is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, but that the Myſteries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:49873:192"/> will ſtill be too high, and too vaſt for him to take a full view of; Since the Mind will not bear to be continually intent, and leaſt of all upon Spiritual and Divine Subjects, and even the moſt vigilant Man muſt have his Seaſons of ſlumbring; Since, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Corruptions of Senſe, and the Violences of Paſſion, and the Fondneſs for the World, will ever carry ſome ſway in a Creature, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Body, as well as Soul; Since Senſual Allurements will entice ſometimes, and outward Diſtreſſes ſometimes ruffle and diſtemper the beſt diſpoſed Minds; The Defects of Faith in us all are but too manifeſt; and the moſt ſtedfaſt Believer, does not diſparage his Virtue, or injure his own Merit; if, to that profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Perſon in my Text, <hi>Lord I believe,</hi> he condeſcend to add his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er too, and ſay, <hi>Lord help my unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The other part of my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking is to ſatisfy the Perſons deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Spirit, beyond what there is juſt occaſion for; Such as, becauſe they with grief diſcover ſome failing and weakneſs of Faith, are apt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:49873:192"/> to ſuſpect that it is wholly want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and imagine it would be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, in ſuch as they are, to ſay <hi>Lord I believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in that Subject too we have gained this Advantage too by what hath been ſaid already, That it is not every ſort of Doubting or Diſpute with a Man's ſelf about the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion; Not every Slip and falſe Step made through Surpriſe, or Forgetfulneſs, or Inconſideration, Not every compliance with a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, nor every Regret and Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon the Account of Afflictions, when they are ſent upon us; that muſt go for an Argument of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a State of Infidelity. Some Inſtances indeed there may be under each of theſe kinds, that greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger a Man's Salvation, and are juſt matter of Diſcomfort to him; But ohers are ſuch, as he may lye under, and yet his Soul be ſtill in a very ſafe and good Condition. But the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing between theſe more preciſely, and directing how to judge of our ſelves and Them, you muſt wait for a little longer; That being reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:49873:193"/> for the Buſineſs of my <hi>Third</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>In the mean while I obſerve, that nothing is more plain in Scripture, than theſe two Truths, (1.) That ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Men may have True Faith, and each of them have it in different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions: And alſo, (2.) That One and the Same Man may believe truly, and yet believe at one time more ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly than at another. Which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations are both of them True in all the Caſes, and the ſeveral inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Faith before-mentioned; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we reſpect it only as an <hi>Aſſent</hi> of the Mind, or whether as a Principle of Virtue, and well-doing, I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my ſelf by ſome Paſſages to be met with in the New Teſtament.</p>

Chriſt applies to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to his gracious dealings with Weak Men, that Prophecy, of <hi>not</hi>

And thus in reaſon we muſt conclude it to be. For Faith is a
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:49873:194"/> Habit of the Mind, and, as ſuch, it muſt needs admit of Degrees, and is capable of being greater or leſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing its Nature, or ceaſing to be Faith. The growth of the Soul is like that of the Body, gentle and ſlow, owing to long time, and much nouriſhment, and repeated exerciſe; So that, As the Humane Nature is the ſame in a Child of a Span long, tho' in leſs proportions then, as to every part of it; Faith is likewiſe the ſame in thoſe whom the Scripture calls <note place="margin">1 Pet.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:49873:195"/> are; and the Comfort of Others in reality, better than they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be; you may remember, was This:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> To aſſign ſome Reaſons for the Weakneſs and Imperfection of Faith; and Theſe, ſuch as every Man will find himſelf more or leſs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To ſhew, That thoſe things which many people are apt to ſuſpect in themſelves, as Signs of Unbelief, or that they have no true Faith, are not in reality any ſuch Signs.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To lay down ſome Rules, whereby the Want of true Faith may be diſtinguiſhed from the Weakneſs of it; And how any Perſon, by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his own Conſcience, may diſcern, whether his Belief be conſiſtent with the Terms of Salvation or not.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe Heads hath been already diſpatched; and ſome progreſs made in the <hi>Second;</hi> So far, as to ſhew, that Faith, like all other Graces, admits of ſeveral degrees, and that the Imperfection is no ſure proof of the total and abſolute Want of it.</p>
            <p>But now, becauſe Many People of honeſt Deſires, and ſincere Inclinations
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:49873:195"/> to Godlineſs, are ſometimes involved in many uncomfortable Scruples upon this occaſion, I promiſed farther to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſome of the principal Doubts, which uſed to give ſuch Men trouble. And to that I now proceed.</p>
            <p>Theſe Diſcomforts, (ſo far as I have had occaſion to obſerve them) uſually ariſe, either (1.) From ſome Failings which Men feel or fancy in themſelves, or (2.) From the Want of ſuch eaſy and peaceful Reſentments of Mind, as true Faith, and a Piety which God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, is always ſuppoſed to produce. I ſhall briefly conſider each of theſe forts, ſo far as is neceſſary to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the Failings Men find or fancy in themſelves, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſuch as theſe; <hi>The falling now and then into ſome grievous Sin; The ſeeming decay of Grace,</hi> and this is gathered from their not perceiving themſelves to grow in it. <hi>Their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not always ſo well diſpoſed to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Duties,</hi> or <hi>ſo zealous in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them, as they uſed and ought to be;</hi> Not <hi>Sorrowing enough for paſt Offences;</hi> Or <hi>coming ſhort of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:49873:196"/> ſome Virtues which they would fain attain to.</hi> I think Theſe are either the chief Objections, that Men uſe to urge againſt themſelves; Or at leaſt, that the Reſt may eaſily be reduced within this compaſs, and will admit of the ſame Anſwers with theſe. In which I ſhall not need to enlarge very much, becauſe what I have already diſcourſed concerning the general Cauſes of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith; and the Reality e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of that Faith which is but Weak, does in a great meaſure contain the Subſtance of what is requiſite to be ſaid upon theſe ſeveral occaſions.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>falling back into old ſins,</hi> is indeed a very ſad Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and ſo much the more ſo, as thoſe falls are more frequent, and the Sins into which we fall are more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. But, when we have remembred withal, that the moſt vigilant mind is not always awake; that the Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Faith, and Zeal for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are not always enforced to the utmoſt, nor will the Nature of Man bear perpetual Application, and intenſe Thought; Though this unhappineſs may well be allowed to create us ſome
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:49873:196"/> diſſatisfaction, yet is it not of ſo evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as to miniſter any juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Diſtruſt, or abſolute Deſpair. For ſtill we have this Conſideration to ſupport us, That the great Judge of all the Earth will not fail to do Right; <hi>that,</hi> when He brings us to Account, all fair and reaſonable Allowances will be made, both for the weak and blind ſides of the Nature he hath given us, the ſurpriſes and ſudden Accidents which prevail upon our impotence, and enſnare us before we have leiſure to make head againſt them; the Intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glements of the World, and the vaſt variety of Temptations, that hem us in; and the ſtrength of ſenſual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, which wearies out the Soul, in our continual ſtruggles with it. Theſe are ſuch misfortunes as every Man's Condition lays him open to: And from hence it comes to paſs, that the Virtue even of the moſt perfect is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its Blemiſhes; That Repentance is the conſtant Buſineſs of Life; For, though a total change ſhould be made once for all; yet They, who purpoſe moſt, and proſecute their good Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions beſt, will every day diſcover ſomething that had better not have been
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:49873:197"/> done, or at leaſt ſomething that might have been done better. Something that either needs to be corrected, or is capable of being improved. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the moſt cautions walker with God does not always order his goings, not only ſo, as to prevent falſe Steps, and ſmall Errors; but now and then wanders very far, and ſtumbles, and falls very dangerouſly.</p>
            <p>To this very purpoſe is it, that (our Bl. Saviour excepted, who was God as well as Man) the Holy Scripture hath no where propoſed any Perſon whatever, as an eminent pattern of Virtue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking particular notice of ſome very remarkable Fault or other in that Man's Converſation. And ſurely the Anger and Impatience of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Adultery and Murder committed by <hi>David,</hi> and the Denial of Chriſt by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> were not only intended to humble thoſe, who are ſo far tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with an Opinion of their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, as to think they cannot fall; But alſo to raiſe and ſtrengthen them that do fall: For theſe prove, that there is a wide difference between a Mans doing things things unworthy of Religion, and wholly abandoning all
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:49873:197"/> the Principles of it: Between forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God for a Seaſon, and totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying or departing from him altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And, that He is often provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to be very angry with thoſe, whom yet he ſees fit to Compaſſionate, and not caſt off utterly.</p>
            <p>The plain Truth of this Matter is; Humane Nature ſtands upon ſo ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery Ground, is thruſt at ſo ſore, and ſo fatally prone to ſtrike in with the Enemies and Temptations that ſeek its Ruine, that it may well exerciſe our wonder, how Men preſerve themſelves ſo often, and recover ſo ſucceſsfully; but, that the Beſt ſhould ſometimes fall, and need ſuch Recoveries, cannot to any conſidering Man appear ſtrange at all. Again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some there are, who, though they cannot accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of any notorious Relapſes, (ſuch as thoſe we laſt mentitioned) yet que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the truth of their Faith, becauſe <hi>they do not perceive themſelves to grow in it, nor do they find their Souls at all times ſo well diſpoſed to the Duties of Religon, or ſo zealous in the performance of them, as they deſire and ought to be;</hi> and therefore
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:49873:198"/> what they ſee ſtand ſtill, or at leaſt i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine to do ſo, they conclude goes backward: That the Fruits of the Spirit are blaſted, which do not apparently thrive, and approach to viſible matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: And that their Graces are quite extinct, becauſe they do not always burn bright, and ſhine out with a clear flame.</p>
            <p>Now in Anſwer to any diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this kind, we are to conſider, that Theſe are very falſe meaſures to take an Eſtimate of our ſelves by; and that our Graces are not always to be judged according to their viſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; And that for theſe Two very good Reaſons, <hi>Firſt, Becauſe ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes are not always neceſſary to our Safety;</hi> And then <hi>Secondly, Becauſe indeed they are not always viſible to us, even when they are actually made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſay <hi>ſuch Increaſes are not always neceſſary to our Safety.</hi> In the Products of Nature, we know, there is a ſet proportion, beyond which, if any thing grow, All afterwards is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant and rather Excreſcence, and Deformity, than any juſt Perfection. This indeed cannot be ſaid in the caſe
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:49873:198"/> of our Souls; for no man can be too Virtuous, or too excellently Good. But then it is as true, That the ſame pitch of Spiritual Strength and Grace, is no more requiſite to make all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons true Chriſtians, and true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; than the ſame Tallneſs of Stature, and Largeneſs of Limbs are required in every one to make him a true Man. And therefore, when our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes his aſſiſtance, it is only thus, that <hi>his</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. XII. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Grace ſhall be ſufficient for us,</hi> That is, we ſhall have all neceſſary Supplies. But it is very certain, that the Neceſſities of Men differ, according to their ſeveral Circumſtances and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities in the World, and as Theſe change, ſo their occaſions change al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Now from hence it will follow, both, that what is ſufficient for One Man, is not ſo for Another; And likewiſe, that what is ſufficient for the ſame Perſon at One time, may not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his Exigencies, nor ſuffice for his purpoſe at Another time. In a Poſt of Eminence, and Authority, where a Man's Office obliges him to inſtruct, or govern others, a larger ſhare of Wiſdom, and Prudence, and Piety is needful, to arm ſuch a one againſt the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:49873:199"/> hazards of a Publick employment, and enable him to lead and to warn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by becoming <hi>a burning and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Light</hi> in his Generation, and inſpiring his Charge by a pious Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>And, even in the moſt private Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Temptations and Tryals aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault a Man, ſo there is more preſſing want of Faith; And of a greater ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and abundance ſtill, the thicker thoſe Darts of the Wicked are ſhot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and the more furious and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery they are, which this Faith alone can quench. The Wiſdom of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours does not think the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations neceſſary in time of Peace, as when actually in a State of War; But provides againſt Surpriſes, and is content to defer the Arming, or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their Forces, till Action calls for them. And thus it is ſufficient, to be aſſured, that, upon great Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, God's Strength ſhall be always ready at hand, and <hi>made perfect in our weakneſs,</hi> provided we be diligent and honeſt; that is, if we uſe the Strength we have, and do not indulge, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly contribute to, our own Weakneſs. Let it be allowed then,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:49873:199"/> that a Man is not deceived in theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of himſelf; And, that his Faith do not make any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Advance; yet if his Condition be ſuch as does not call for any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Additions, the Caſe is ſtill well enough. For, as no Man hath need to call his Health in queſtion, who feels no indiſpoſition of Body, though he do not perceive himſelf to grow e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day ſtronger; So, if our Faith be but a preſervative from Lapſes and Errors, and ſecure us againſt Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sickneſs and Death; if we do not Languiſh and become manifeſtly cold and feeble in God's Service, nor find our Souls infected with Sin and Luſt, This is a good Argument that our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Health is good. And, though a greater Degree, and higher perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may be Deſirable perhaps, yet ſtill they are not Neceſſary, nor ſhall we periſh for the want of them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, where all theſe Bleſſings depend upon the mere Bounty and free Gift of our Maſter, we ought not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet our ſelves with Reflections upon what we have not, but rejoyce and be thankful for what we have. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that we are admitted into his
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:49873:200"/> Favour, that he ſnatches us from Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and allows us any place at all in his preſence; and will much better become us to ſit down pleaſed, and take the loweſt Room, than to diſcontent our ſelves, and loſe the comfort of what we Enjoy, by repining that we are not taken <hi>to ſit on his right hand, and an his left, in his Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But then we are to conſider in the next place, that <hi>our Faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graces do very often increaſe, and we in the mean while perceive it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What our Church in one of her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles teaches us to confeſs, is moſt certain, <note place="margin">Acts XII.</note> That <hi>Good Works do naturally flow from Faith, ſo that by them a true Faith may be known, as evidently as a Tree by its Fruit.</hi> The meaning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this, that what we call <hi>Faith,</hi> if it produce no good Deeds, is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Dead, and none at all. But it is by no means a juſt Conſequence from hence, that no Faith is lively and true, which is not perpetually exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf in New inſtances, any more, than that the Tree is Dead, which is not always Green, and always bearing. For our Souls have, in ſome ſenſe, their
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:49873:200"/> Winters too, and the Seaſons of ſprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting again into Verdancy, and Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. If therefore, either want of Opportunities to ſhew it ſelf, keep it hid; or the Storms of Affliction ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and put it back for a while; we have no reaſon to be diſcouraged, or deſpair of its Life; But may conclude, that, as the Corn lies covered, and yet gathers Strength when under Ground; ſo this Faith may grow and flouriſh, and fit it ſelf for great and glorious undertakings, even when we have no viſible ſigns, nor ſenſible proofs of its doing ſo. And ſuch indeed is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all Habits whatſoever, whoſe Excellency conſiſts, not in perpetual Action, but in a Readineſs and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly Diſpoſition to act as becomes them, ſo often only, as proper occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are offered to exerciſe them.</p>
            <p>Nay farther yet, I add, that, though ſome things ſhould appear to us, which look very ſuſpicious, and ſeem to argue great Decays at leaſt, if not abſolute Deadneſs of Faith; ſuch as the being <hi>ſometimes indiſpoſed to the Duties of Religion,</hi> and feeling our Zeal leſs warm and vigorous than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:49873:201"/> yet are not theſe Symptoms of ſo fatal Conſequence, that we ſhould conclude againſt the Reality of our Faith, or at all deſpair of our Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Health and Safety from them.</p>
            <p>Were the Soul indeed ſingle by it ſelf, and in a Condition to exert its own Powers, without any Lett or Contradiction, then we might expect, that it ſhould be ſteddy and uniform in all its Operations. But here the Wiſe-Man's Obſervation takes place, That <note n="*" place="margin">Wiſd. IX. 15. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               <hi>the corruptible body preſſeth down the Soul, and the Earthly taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle weigheth down the Mind, that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth upon many things;</hi> or as the word might properly enough be render'd, <hi>the mind encumbred with many cares.</hi> And This in truth is Our Caſe. We are Subject to all the Neceſſities, and detain'd by all the Clogs and Hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of a Body. Expoſed to all the Trouble of ſupplying its Wants; and by that means, to all the Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and all the Anxieties of the World; ſubject to all its Diſorders and Infirmities; forced to act by, as well as with it, and ſo liable to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and diverted by its Paſſions
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:49873:201"/> and Pleaſures, its Pains, and its Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. This is the very Reaſon, Not only why One Man differs ſo vaſtly from Another; but why the Same Man differs ſometimes ſo ſtrangely from Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he ſcarce appears to be the Same. And, ſince the very ſame Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are the Springs of our Actions and Reſentments in Religious Matters, which are in all Other Affairs; it muſt needs follow, that, as thoſe Springs are differently ſet, and we differently mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them, the alterations we feel in point of Duty and Devotion, as they belong to the ſame Cauſes, ſo they will vary in like proportions, as in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and worldly Concerns. So that, as we have differing Conſtitutions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us at firſt, or as any Accidents af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards change thoſe we have; it ought not to ſeem ſtrange, much leſs to create us any great Trouble or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, if the Temper of our Minds, and our Diſpoſitions to God and Goodneſs, ſhall happen to vary accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. The Cold and Phlegmatick will not find all thoſe ſprightly Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Heart as the Sanguine and Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man; Nor will This Man again feel the ſame Depth of Godly Sorrow
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:49873:202"/> and ſad Remorſe, nor the like compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in the Auſterities and Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of a penitent State, with one of a blacker and more heavy Blood. Thus Fear, and Love of God, and a ſtedfaſt Affiance in him, and Charity and Kindneſs to one another, though they be general Duties, ſuch as All are obliged to, and may arrive at a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Degree of; yet All will not find it equally eaſy to practice them. But Thoſe Perſons will attain to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Perfections in theſe Virtues, and exerciſe them with leſs Difficulty, and a more ſenſible Delight, whom their own natural Complexions have moſt diſpoſed toward Each of them. For Every one hath not the ſame Prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in himſelf to fear, or to love, to truſt, or to deſpond, to be good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, or to be ſordid. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, As the Work muſt needs be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, where Nature muſt be oppoſed and over-ruled; ſo no doubt it is half done to our hands, where we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready poſſeſt with theſe happy Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, when Inclination goes before, and directs us in our way to Duty.</p>
            <pb n="387" facs="tcp:49873:202"/>
            <p>Now what Nature does once for all in forming our Conſtitutions at firſt, The Accidents of this Life, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of our Bodies, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other Occaſional Things do for a time with us. That is, They give a preſent turn to our minds; and, while theſe Impreſſions laſt upon us, inſpire our Souls with ſtronger inclinations and averſions than uſual, and diſpoſe or indiſpoſe us more, than, in our ſelves, and according to our general Temper, we are wont to be, toward them.</p>
            <p>The Sobereſt and moſt Conſiderate Perſon cannot always preſerve ſuch an Evenneſs of Spirit, that no Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, no ſudden Guſts of Anger, or Grief or ſome other Paſſion, ſhould not ſometimes render his Thoughts tumultuous and diſorderly. Thoſe that <hi>ſeek the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs firſt,</hi> yet muſt allow ſome part of their time and pains, in an honeſt ſearch of the leſs important Conveniencies of this Life; And Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Care, though they be ſo well guarded as not to diſſettle, yet they will in ſome meaſure divert the mind from the <hi>One thing</hi> neceſſary. A Man thus incumbred, cannot return
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:49873:203"/> from the World to God all on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with the ſame fixed and ſedate Compoſure of Mind, as if no other thoughts had mingled themſelves with his Religious ones. But eſpecially; The Soul and Body are linked together in ſo cloſe a band, their operations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another reciprocally are ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quick and powerful, that it is ſcarce to be conceived, how ſtrangely they labour under one anothers infirmities: And how great and ſpeedy a change the Soul and all its affections feel, by every little Alteration that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to the Body. How the Mind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ults and enlarges it ſelf, when This is in good health and temper; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, how it languiſhes, and is cramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up under every indiſpoſition, every accidental diſturbance, that ſhakes the fleſhly Tabernacle, in which it dwells. How Age and Sickneſs do not only waſte our Strength, and wither our Limbs, but enervate our Minds too, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeble all their Operations, and, as it were disjoynt all their Powers. How mighty a ſtroke all theſe things carry, and what Changes they make in us, Every one, who does at all conſider, and look into himſelf, will quickly find,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:49873:203"/> None of us is able at all times alike to maintain the ſame Eaſineſs of Humour, and Freedom in common Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. None is always equally qualified to think, or bend his mind to buſineſs; but even our Underſtandings have their Lucid, and their Clouded intervals. And if That part of our Mind, which hath leaſt of all to do with the Body, be yet affected with the ſeveral Habits of it; How much more muſt thoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (the Will, and the Deſires) be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them, whoſe buſineſs lies chiefly with thoſe Appetites and Inclinations, which Fleſh and Senſe converſe with, and are moved by? How ſtrongly muſt Theſe determine us in Acts of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Devotion particularly; and Inſpire Warmth, or chill us with Cold, when thoſe Affections are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part chiefly employed? All which is the more neceſſary to be obſerved, that Men may be ſet right in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of themſelves; and not raſhly pronounce, as they frequently do, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the State of their Souls, and the hopes of Eternal Salvation, from ſuch things as are not of a Spiritual Relation, but proceed merely from Natural and Neceſſary Cauſes. For
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:49873:204"/> Thus in effect it is, that the <hi>Incomes</hi> and <hi>Deſertions</hi> which Some people affect to talk of ſo much, and lay ſuch mighty ſtreſs upon, are neither the Graces, nor the Defects of their mind, ſo much as the preſent Habit of the Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and the particular Temper and Conſtitution of their Bodies.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Next</hi> Objection ſeems to carry much more reaſon of Diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is, when Men apprehend, that <hi>they are not ſufficiently ſorry for their paſt Sins.</hi> For This is a moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Duty; and He that does not ſorrow enough, does it to very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe. But here again the whole Difficulty lies, in determining <hi>what is Enough.</hi> The misfortune of Perſons in their Doubts concerning Remorſe for ſin is, that they miſtake the Nature of Sorrow upon theſe Occaſions. It is ſuppoſed by many, that this Sorrow does of it ſelf recommend us to God, and is, for its own ſake, exceeding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him; That herein chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſts the Repentance of a Sinner; As appears (they tell you) from the mournful Complaints of <hi>David,</hi> the bitter Weeping of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and Other
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:49873:204"/> inſtances of Holy Penitents in Scripture. All which are our Patterns, and, when we fall ſhort of Their Anguiſh and Grief of Heart, it is to be feared, that we want Their Faith and Their Sincerity. And therefore it is urged, that no Man's Soul ought to ſpeak comfort to him, without the like Humiliations, the like inward perplexities and groanings of Spirit, the like <hi>watering our Couch with Tears,</hi> and <hi>making our Bed to ſwim in the Night-Seaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all this is owing, as I ſaid, to a wrong apprehenſion of this Godly Sorrow, and not diſtinguiſhing between the End it is to promote, and the Sorrow it ſelf which is but as the Mean, and Way to that End. St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught us, <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. VII. 10.</note> 
               <hi>that this worketh repentance not to be repented of;</hi> But that which worketh Repentance, is plainly a part, or an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, or a Cauſe of it only, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Whole, nor the Perfection of the thing it works. Repentance is the Change of Heart and Life, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a better Senſe, and acting more wiſely for the time to come. Where this is done effectually, God accepts the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, let the degree of Sorrow that brought him to it, have been what it will.
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:49873:205"/> And where this is not done, no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Sorrow is pleaſing in his ſight. Our Good is the thing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. He delights in the change of our Manners, and the correcting of our Wills; and no Affliction or Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart can give pleaſure to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo infinitely Kind as God, (who is Love and Goodneſs in its utmoſt Perfection) any farther, than thoſe Dejections of mind contribute to our ſubſtantial Holineſs, and thorough Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            <p>It is highly expedient indeed, that we ſhould be moſt heartily concerned for having done amiſs, becauſe what we are truly ſorry for we ſhall not eaſily be induced to repeat, or ſuffer our ſelves to be reconciled to any more. And ſuch a Concern will be the natural reſult of a ſerious Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how we diſhonour God and our ſelves by a wicked Life; what Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance we have provoked, and what Mercies we have abuſed. But, ſince all our Indignation, and Shame, and Zeal, and Deteſtation of our former Offences, tends only to the hating and forſaking them effectually; the Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of theſe depends upon the effect
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:49873:205"/> they have upon our future Behaviour. And, as every ſorrowful Man is not truly penitent, ſo many true penitents make no very great appearances of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. And it is not the Tears, or the Sighs, or the Melancholy Bewailings of our Miſery, but the After-Acts of our Lives, from whence we muſt take the true meaſures and marks of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>All other Teſtimonies are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceitful, and ſuch as no man can with any good aſſurance depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For, beſides that nothing ſhort of ſerious Amendment, the cleanſing of the Hands, and purifying the Heart anſwers the deſign of our Contrition; there is ſo great a variety of Tempers among Men, that no ſure Concluſion can be made from One Man to Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Some are ſo tender and ſoft, that the ſlighteſt occaſions ſuffice to melt them into tears: And Others ſo tough and impenetrable, that they can enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſevereſt Accidents, without any appearance of Concern. Some again quickly compoſe and recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and when once their Grief hath gotten a vent, it is preſently forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten again; and they are the ſame gay
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:49873:206"/> Perſons, as if no Evil had happened to them. Others Affliction takes abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute poſſeſſion of, no time will wear it off, No comforts will appeaſe their troubled Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. So that no fixed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Grief can be ſo accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, as to fit the Circumſtances of ſuch diſtant Conſtitutions. The Rule then in common to both ſorts, is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of thoſe Impreſſions: Which, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Violence, or their Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be more or leſs, is only then of equal force and value in Both, when Both are alike reformed by them, alike prevailed upon to commit no more thoſe Follies, which have been the juſt cauſe of ſo much Diſquiet to their Minds.</p>
            <p>The Lamentations indeed of thoſe famous Penitents in Scripture do much ſurpaſs the Uſual Proportions of moſt Chriſtian's Grief, ſo far as we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to gueſs. And it was fit, that They who had given ſuch inſtances of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Frailty, in falling ſo grievouſly, ſhould be as remarkable Patterns of holy Indignation and Zeal, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their Faults, and recovering themſelves from them. This was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commendable In them, and is thus
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:49873:206"/> far an inſtruction to Us, that We ought to afflict our ſelves with ſad remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, in proportion to the Delight, and the Aggravations, with which we offended. But that is, becauſe this After-puniſhment, inflicted by our own hands, will encreaſe our Hatred againſt Sin. A Hatred, that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be too great; and therefore no Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that contributes to it, can be too great neither, provided we find it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the reclaiming us more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and that it do not drive us to Deſpair, or Diſtruſt of God's Mercy, nor rob us of thoſe ſweet Comforts, pronounced to Holy Mourners, and which the Service of God, and a good Conſcience, are deſigned to ſupport, and cheer us with.</p>
            <p>But of This great Care muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and a prudent Temper uſed, like that practiſed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the notorious offender at <hi>Corinth;</hi> Whom, though he had delivered to Satan for the Scandal of his Crime, yet upon his relenting he immediately reſtores, <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. II. 7. 11.</note> 
               <hi>leſt Satan</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſhould take an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over it, and the Man be ſwallowed up with over-much ſorrow.</hi> From whence it is plain, both that there may be a
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:49873:207"/> dangerous exceſs given of Penitential Sorrow, and that ſo much of it as brings us to be duly ſenſible of our Sins, and diligent to avoid and make amends for them hereafter, is ſufficient for our purpoſe, and pleaſes God ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well. So that No Man need tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment himſelf with a Scruple of not ſorrowing for his Sins as he ought, provided he have but effectually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and reformed them. For we grieve only, that we may hate and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them; and therefore we ought to aſſure our ſelves, that God, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards our Virtue, will accept it by what means ſoever it be wrought. That, if the Cure be made, it is the ſame thing, whether the Remedies that effected it, were Corroſives or Lenitives. And ſure we ought rather to be thankful, that God had Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on our Infirmities, and ſpared us from abſolute Dejection, and uſed his gentler methods of healing; ſince he meaſures our Repentance, not by the quantity of our Years, or the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Complaints, but by the Sincerity of our Hearts, and the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Lives, for the time to come.</p>
            <pb n="397" facs="tcp:49873:207"/>
            <p>And now, as to the <hi>Falling ſhort of ſome Vertues,</hi> which was the <hi>Laſt</hi> of thoſe Failings before mentioned, from whence Men are uſed to doubt of their having True Faith; We ought not to be diſquieted at This neither; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theſe be ſuch Virtues, as are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for us to excel in, and our own endeavours be wanting to obtain them. Every Condition and Relation of humane Life brings its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Duties and Obligations along with it. And Others, except thoſe which are General, and Concern eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man in Order to Salvation, do not fall within the Compaſs of our preſent practice. But even of Thoſe that do, we are no where promiſed, that we ſhall preſently attain them, upon our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to do ſo. God ſees ſit many times to leave a Luſt unſubdued, and to withold the Perfection of ſome Grace from us, thereby to keep us in Action, and to continue us Humble. Conſtant Succeſs, in Spiritual as well as Temporal Affairs, is apt to blow us up with Pride, and make us not only Vain, but Idle and Careleſs too. And therefore, both our Modeſty and our
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:49873:208"/> Diligence ſtand in need of Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Wants, and Diſappointments to preſerve them. So that the miſſing of One Virtue in this Caſe, often prevents the loſs of Another. The Check of what we Deſire, procures the Advance of ſomewhat more profitable for us. If <hi>Knowledge</hi> be deny'd us, becauſe there is danger of its <hi>puffing us up,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> which is more to Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, be planted in its ſtead, it is a Bleſſed Exchange, and God hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a better choice for us. But beſides, As God does not require all Virtues from Each man, ſo neither does he expect the ſame Degrees of the ſame Virtues from Every Man. In a Word; He will call no Man to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for more than he was enabled to perform. If We do our parts, our Faith, and our Integrity ſhall be approved; and if we want not Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and Endeavour, the want of Succeſs ſhall never be imputed to us. It will not call our Salvation into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard in the Day of Judgment, and therefore it ſhould not diſquiet us in the Day of Tryal.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with thoſe Scruples, which are wont to riſe from
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:49873:208"/> the Failings we feel or fancy in our ſelves. Thoſe that proceed from the expectation of ſuch eaſy and peaceful Reſentments of Mind, as are imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned always to attend Piety and true Faith, ſhall be conſidered (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) in another Diſcourſe.</p>

            <p>MY deſign from theſe Words, was to treat of a Weak and Imperfect Faith and, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of that Deſign, I have already
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:49873:209"/> aſſigned ſome Reaſons for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith, ſuch, and ſo general, that all People will find themſelves more or leſs concerned in them; which was my Firſt Head.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Second</hi> propoſed to ſatisfy the Scruples of many well-meaning Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon this occaſion; by ſhewing, that thoſe things which are frequently ſuſpected, as ſigns of their having no True Faith, are really not ſo. Now, Theſe being of Two ſorts, Some, that proceed from a ſight or an imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome Failings in Men's own ſelves; and Others, from the want of ſuch eaſineſs and peace of mind, as are ſuppoſed conſtantly to attend true Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Faith; The Former of theſe Kinds have been already conſider'd particularly, and the Latter come now under our Examination, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe Diſſatisfactions, which are apt to ariſe from the want of ſuch eaſy and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reſentments of Mind, as true Faith, and that Piety which God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, are always ſuppoſed to produce.</p>
            <p>Now of Theſe I commonly meet with Two, which ſeem moſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Conſideration, And they are,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:49873:210"/> 
               <hi>First, Mens doubting of their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Election and Salvation;</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The want of thoſe inward Joys, and that preſent constant peace of heart, which Religion is ſo often ſaid in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to cheer our Spirits with, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it ſelf to us by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then, I ſhall endeavour to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy you, that for Men to <hi>doubt of their own particular Election and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> (as that Phraſe is commonly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) <hi>is not any Argument, that they want true Faith.</hi> Nor indeed could it ever have been thought one, if a ſort of Vain Men had not led their Followers away, with a ſtrange delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding imagination, that it was One ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary part and Character of a true Belief in Chriſt, to perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their own perſonal Election, and that it was impoſſible they ſhould ever miſcarry; So that not to reſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their own Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, (as they repreſent the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) a Diſtruſt of Chriſt's mercy, and of the Faithfulneſs of God to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, ſince <hi>his gifts, and his calling are without Repentance, and whom he once loveth, he loveth them unto the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="403" facs="tcp:49873:210"/>
            <p>Now when people are told in ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry confident and peremptory terms, that This is the Faith, by which they muſt be ſaved, and, that to queſtion their own Eternal Happineſs, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable proof, that no ſuch thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them; And, when at the ſame time upon examination of their own breaſts, and an humble ſight of their many Failings and Infirmities, they cannot reſt in all that fulneſs of aſſurance, but find ſome little Miſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and Fears mixed with their Hopes; We are not to wonder, if they lye under ſad anxieties, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactions, ſo long as they believe themſelves wanting in a Condition, abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation; But Such is not this poſitive Aſſurance, whatever is pretended; nor in truth can it be; as I hope to convince you in few words, and, by ſo doing, moſt offectually to put and End to all thoſe Scruples and Diſquiets, that are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing merely to this falſe preſumption of its being ſo, and, that there can be no true Faith without it.</p>
            <p>To believe, that God out of a gracious deſign to ſave Mankind from
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:49873:211"/> Hell and everlaſting Deſtruction, ſent his Son into the World to dye for them; And, that All ſuch as Believe and obey the Goſpel, ſhall moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, by His merits, have their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience accepted, and their Souls made eternally happy; This indeed is a true, and a neceſſary Belief; And to queſtion This, is to diſtruſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God; It is to contradict his word, and to blaſpheme his Truth. But for You, or Me in particular, to believe that We are of this happy number, This can never be required of us, as a poſitive Duty. Nor hath the Goſpel enjoin'd it, any farther than, by the Teſtimony of our own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and the word of God, we find our ſelves within thoſe General terms, by which the Goſpel promiſes Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Mankind at large. And you will, I think, agree, that, even in very Good men, it cannot be expected This ſhould amount to a poſitive aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when you have conſidered the following Arguments.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is not poſſible, I conceive, <hi>to reconcile ſuch an abſolute aſſurance with Fear.</hi> And yet the Goſpel plainly
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:49873:211"/> propounds this as a proper, and very powerful motive to a Chriſtian's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, For however that may have been run down, as a Spirit contrary to the Genius of the New Covenant, and the New Creature; <note n="*" place="margin">Pſ. cxi. 10.</note> yet it is not plainer, that the Old Teſtament pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the <note n="*" place="margin">Phil. II. 12, 13.</note> beginning of Religious Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Fear of the Lord, than it is, that the New attributes the very finiſhing and Excellence of it to the ſame Affection of mind; and makes the very Mercies of God in Chriſt a foundation for it. For ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſes the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (2 Ep. Chap. VII. v. 1.) <hi>Having therefore theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, dearly beloved, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs both of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> Where, it is plain, he ſpoke not to Novices, or to ſuch as were to make their firſt feeble Eſſays by the help of this, and then paſs on to ſome Nobler Motive; but he expects that they ſhould complete their Duty, and become perfect by That. A Vertue ſo far from being inconſiſtent with Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercies, that they are exhorted to fear for that reaſon, becauſe they had ſuch gracious promiſes to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:49873:212"/> The ſame Apoſtle commands his <hi>Philippians,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Phil. II. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>to work out their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with fear and trembling;</hi> that is, in an awe of God's Juſtice conſtantly upon their minds; a conſtant Dread of his Vengeance, and from thence an Anxious Care to pleaſe him. And yet all this is not a Spirit of Bondage; for That could not ſtand with having received the Spirit of Adoption; as theſe <hi>Philippians</hi> had; who are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly encouraged to this diligence in the next verſe, from the conſideration of God's Grace, whereby he works in men <hi>both to will and to do, of his good pleaſure.</hi> Nor may we ſay, (as ſome fondly do) that the Love of God is cooled by ſuch a principle, ſince our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf hath recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the higheſt Act of Love, that men are capable of, no leſs than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Martyrdom it ſelf, and laying down our lives for his ſake, from the ſame motive, Thus he hath choſen to do to his beloved ones, (<hi>Luke</hi> XII. 4. 5.) <hi>I ſay unto you my friends, be not afraid of them that kill the Body, and after that have no more that they can do; But I will forewarn you whom ye ſhall fear; fear him, who after he hath killed,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:49873:212"/> hath, power to cast into hell, yea I ſay unto you, fear him.</hi> How often are we called upon <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. III. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Take heed leſt we depart from God,</hi> Not to be <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. XI. 20.</note> 
               <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, but to fear,</hi> leſt the branches of the Olive be cut off, after they have been grafted in, and others be taken in their ſtead; and to beware of temptation, leſt he <note n="‖" place="margin">1 Cor. X. 12.</note> 
               <hi>who thinketh he standeth,</hi> and truſts too much to his own bottom, <hi>happen at laſt to fall.</hi> Now if any Man can diſcern, how ſuch a Fear as this can agree with a full and undoubted perſwaſion of ones own particular Election and Salvation, then he may allow every Miſgiving of this kind to be a Want of Faith. But, if being afraid, and being certain of the ſelf ſame thing, at the ſame time; If trembling for fear we ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry and offend, and knowing that we cannot poſſibly miſcarry; If taking heed leſt we fall, and yet being obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to believe that God can as ſoon ceaſe to ſtand as We; If theſe things I ſay, be not Contradictions to all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Common Senſe; I muſt own I do not know any thing that is. And then it follows, that the Goſpel, which commands ſuch an awful dread
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:49873:213"/> of God, and fear of our own Safety as we have ſeen; cannot command ſuch an aſſurance, as is inconſiſtent with that fear, and muſt needs deſtroy it. Conſequently then thoſe doubts, which prove the want of ſuch an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute aſſurance, do not prove, that the Perſon who labours under them, wants true Faith, or any qualification requiſite for a Chriſtian Life here, and Heaven hereafter.</p>
            <p>Let it be conſidered, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Such a poſitive Perſwaſion as This cannot be required as a neceſſary act of ſaving Faith, becauſe the <hi>Promiſes of Salvation are themſelves Conditional, and one of thoſe Conditions is Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</hi> The marks, which St. <hi>John</hi> hath given to judge our State by, are ſuch as theſe, <note n="*" place="margin">1 John III. 3.</note> 
               <hi>He that hath this hope in himſelf,</hi> (that is, the hope of ſeeing God as he is, and enjoying his bleſſed preſence for ever in Heaven) <hi>purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">1 John III. 10.</note> 
               <hi>In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the Devil, He that doth not righteouſneſs is not of God.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle declares in the <hi>First</hi> of that Epiſtle, that though he wrote
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:49873:213"/> to them on purpoſe that <note n="*" place="margin">1 John I. 4, 6.</note> 
               <hi>their joy might be full,</hi> yet all the comfort he could give them was this, that <hi>if we ſay we have fellowſhip with him,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>with God the Father and the Lord Jeſus Christ, and walk in darkneſs, we lye, and do not the truth.</hi> Our Life, we know, is a Condition of Diſcipline and Tryal; and what Difficulties and Temptations may ſtill await us none of us all can tell. A good man may look back upon that part already ſpent with great Comfort, and a Holy Truſt; But when the Beſt of Men look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, all they can do, is only to hope well, and reſolve well, for the time to come. And alas! How many of our moſt likely Hopes have been defeated? How many of the Purpoſes, which we made in the Sincerity of our hearts have been broken and baffled hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? And can we then be certain, where all we can do is to pray, and to intend, and to endeavour well; that is, to do again, what we have done perhaps a thouſand times alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, without Succeſs? If our Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions indeed be ſtedfaſt, if our good Intentions be accompliſh'd, upon this Condition we are infallibly ſure; But
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:49873:214"/> can we be infallibly ſure of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition it ſelf? Dare we depend upon our own hearts, which we have found treacherous ſo often before? and not doubt our frail nature, or remember our many infirmities? This ſure, were ſtrange Stupidity, ſtrange Conſidence, ſtrange Forgetfulneſs. In a word, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubting aſſurance is only for Them that have finiſhed their warfare, and come to receive their Crown. But in thoſe who are ſtill in heat of action, and have many ſharp conflicts yet to undergo, many difficult Paſſes, and Ambuſhes to fight their way thro', it is too great a boldneſs, too great a folly, to ſing Songs of Triumph to themſelves, before the danger of the Day be over. It is encouragement e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſtrive lawfully, that in God's due time we ſhall be ſure <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. VI. 9.</note> 
               <hi>to reap, if we faint not.</hi> And if ſome fears of looſing the Prize, be mingled with our Hopes, theſe will but quicken our Care the more. But He that demands to have his Wages made over to him irrevocably, before his Services have given him a Title to them, is an Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Servant. He, it is to be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, does not ask a Security, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:49873:214"/> him in the Hardſhips of his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but rather to indulge Careleſneſs, and cheriſh Preſumption.</p>
            <p>But to ſilence all Scruples in one Word I obſerve, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That ſuch an aſſurance as we have been treating of, <hi>not only is not,</hi> but that it <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be, that Neceſſary Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith commanded in the Goſpel.</hi> For we are told, times without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that <hi>by Faith we are ſaved,</hi> and conſequently whatever Faith is, till we have it, we cannot be in a Condition of being ſaved. But now, if this Faith conſiſt in a peremptory perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and full aſſurance of our own perſonal Salvation, then it follows, that we muſt believe, and be aſſured, that we are in a State of Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are really ſo. Now this is manifeſtly abſurd, and makes what ſuch Men call <hi>Faith,</hi> to be in Effect no other than Ignorance, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. And, on the other hand, If a thing muſt actually be, before we can be aſſured that it is; then we muſt be in a State of Salvation before we can be aſſured that we are ſo; and conſequently That Faith, which puts
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:49873:215"/> us into that State, cannot be a full and undoubted perſwaſion of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it already. And then, I am ſure, there is no reaſon to diſquiet our minds for any ſuch Doubts or Miſgivings, as proceed not from any diſtruſt of God, but of our ſelves; ſuch as fear always, becauſe they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways dread an angry juſtice, and the danger of offending a good and a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God. Theſe Doubts may argue Modeſty, and Humility, but are by no means to be lookt upon as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant mark of Infidelity, or ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Faith, as ſhould endanger our Souls, or give them any diſturbance with regard to their Condition in the next World, merely upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>There remains yet One Objection more to be ſatisfied, which Men are apt ſometimes to make againſt the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their own Faith; and This is derived from <hi>the want of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Joys, and that preſent peace of heart, which a true Piety, ſuch as God accepts, and approves, is ſuppoſed always to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in the Breast of every ſincere Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="413" facs="tcp:49873:215"/>
            <p>Among the many Excellent Motives, whereby it hath pleaſed God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite us to a good Life, None, which concern our preſent happineſs, is more engaging, than that Tranquility of Mind, and thoſe ſweet Overflowings of Pleaſure, which the ſenſe of God's Favour, and the grateful remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of having done well, entertain Good Men withal. And, beſides, the particular Ordinances of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his Servants with theſe preſent Satisfactions, there is ſomewhat in the very nature of the thing, ſo agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo conſtant a reliſh of Virtue, to ſoften the difficulties of it, that a man may well be tempted to ſuſpect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he reaps no ſenſible delight from his endeavours to act worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But yet ſometimes ſo it happens, that this Joy is either withheld, or the ſenſe of it intercepted, and yet no uncomfortable Concluſions, how colourable ſoever, can with certainty be gathered to our prejudice, and that particularly upon theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Accounts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Though this pleaſure of Mind, be a <hi>Common,</hi> and moſt <hi>uſual,</hi>
               <pb n="414" facs="tcp:49873:216"/> yet it is not a <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>inſeparable</hi> Attendant upon well-doing. We find therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> praying for the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>God would fill them with all Joy and Peace in believing,</hi> which ſhews plainly, that theſe are Gifts and Graces, by which God encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges his Servants, and renders their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eaſy to them; But, had theſe been abſolutely inherent in Faith, it had been a very vain thing to have prayed for them; for then they muſt have enjoyed thoſe Bleſſings, from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their embracing the Faith, and in proportion to their Zeal in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting and living up to it. <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. XV. 13.</note> And how odd had it been to beg, that They <hi>might have joy and peace in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,</hi> when at this rate they could not poſſibly believe, but they muſt have Joy and Peace?</p>
            <p>And therefore, when we ſee ſuch things made the Subject of a Petition to God, we may be ſure, they are not any neceſſary ingredient of Faith, but ſomething additional and accidental to it, which may be withheld, or may be granted, at God's good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and without which the Virtue
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:49873:216"/> itſelf may ſubſiſt, and continue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Theſe Comforts God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times does actually withhold, for our greater advantage.</hi> How frequent are the Complaints in Scripture of God's hiding his Face from his Servants? how vehement the Supplications for the light of his Countenance to ſhine out upon them? And this putting himſelf behind the Cloud, as it were, is by no means a conſtant effect of his Diſpleaſure, but a neceſſary Diſcipline and Check upon them that are left in that dark diſconſolate Condition. He knows how apt our Joys, even upon Spiritual Accounts, are to over-ſet us; how any inward Gaiety of heart ſwells and makes us giddy; And therefore theſe Dejections are of no leſs uſe to contain ſome in their Duty, than the contrary Comforts are to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and ſupport Others. 'Tis the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to keep the Sins of one Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and the Image of an angry Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice before his Eyes, that a longer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe may effectually humble him, and prevent a Relapſe; No leſs than it
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:49873:217"/> is, to ſuſtain Others by the raviſhing Ideas of his Mercy, that Theſe may cheer the faint and feeble, and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue them from Deſpair. He beſt knows our Tempers, and what Remedies and Diet are proper for the ſeveral ſorts of them. Thoſe, whoſe diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes require it, ſhall have <hi>Angels Food</hi> and <hi>Meat enough;</hi> Others, who are not to be truſted with ſuch delicious fare, ſhall be fed with the <hi>Bread of Affliction,</hi> and have <hi>plenteouſneſs of Tears to drink.</hi> And this ſevere diſpenſation, if rightly improved, ſo as to keep us low, and wean us from the World, and inflame our Zeal and Devotion to ſeek God's Face more earneſtly, will at laſt break forth in marvellous Joy, and, like a Cloudy Morning, burſt out into a warm and glorious Day. The Sun of Righteouſneſs will not fail in his due time to ſhed his refreſhing Beams upon our Head, and double the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and recompence all the paſt long Night, by riſing, not with comfort only, but which is more deſirable, with <hi>healing under his Wings.</hi> For this <hi>tryal of our Faith worketh patience, and if patience have her perfect work,</hi> then (<hi>St. James</hi> tells us, <hi>Jam.</hi> I. 4.) we
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:49873:217"/> 
               <hi>ſhall be perfect and entire, wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To ſpeak my thoughts freely on this occaſion, I am clearly of Opinion, that the moſt uſual Cauſe of theſe Scruples is Melancholy, and a diſeaſed Blood. When the Spirits are low and ſluggiſh, and depreſs the mind, then every thing looks black, and diſmal; and the diſtempers of the <hi>outward</hi> Man, are miſtaken for the deſertions of the <hi>inward.</hi> The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is diſturbed, and the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination ſo blotted and ſtained, that it makes a falſe <hi>Medium,</hi> and nothing appears in its true ſhape or colour. In this confuſion Men are the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified that can be, to make any judgment concerning the State of their own Souls. They cannot be brought to believe themſelves ſuch as they are, and they run away with ſtrong noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their being ſuch as they are not. Examine what Ground they have for their lamentations, what grievous, wilful, and habitual Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they can accuſe themſelves of, which ſhould juſtify their Terrors, and provoke God to forſake them;
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:49873:218"/> yet ſtill, though their Conſciences condemn them not, all comes to one, and loſt they are ſure they are: Though Others, who ſee their Condition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice, and weigh it imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, are aſſured both from Scripture and Reaſon, that it is not, cannot be ſo with them. So impoſſible is it ſometimes for a Man to know himſelf, and ſo exceeding deaf does this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Complexion render Men, not only to all Comfort, but to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Reaſon and Argument. And, which is yet worſe, Religion it ſelf ſuffers by this means, and the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its Joys and ſecret Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies is ſeverely reflected upon by the Ignorant; (though moſt unjuſtly) when We, who are Miniſters of the Goſpel, do not remove theſe diſmal Agonies. Whereas, in truth, they are no part of Our Buſineſs, but require Phyſicians of another Kind: and that which commonly paſſes for Trouble of Mind, and a wounded Conſcience, is no Malady of the Mind at all, nor capable of being cured by all the <hi>Balm</hi> in the <hi>Spiritual Gilead;</hi> but purely a Bodily Diſtemper, and only to be compoſed by Bodily Applications.</p>
            <pb n="419" facs="tcp:49873:218"/>
            <p>So that, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> For the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Truth, we muſt obſerve; That theſe Promiſes of inward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Satisfaction to Good Men, are to be underſtood, as all thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Promiſes of <hi>Long Life,</hi> and <hi>Health,</hi> and <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Proſperous Succeſs,</hi> and every Temporal Bleſſing: That is, So as to be true for the moſt part, and except ſome better thing be given in their ſtead: But not ſo univerſally true, as to admit of no extraordinary and reſerved Caſes; nor to oblige God never to ſend Trouble of Mind, or any other Afflictions, upon his beſt and moſt beloved Servants, when he ſees this moſt expedient; Profitable for the Tryal and Increaſe of their Vertue and Patience, or any otherwiſe more for the Eternal Good of their Souls.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears evidently, That, the Joy of Well-Doing does not always accompany the Action it ſelf. Sometimes it is ſeparated from it by God, who ſends this Anguiſh and Tribulation of Spirit, and conſults our Advantage by theſe unpleaſant Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods; And ſometimes an unhappy Conſtitution ſheds its Venom upon the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:49873:219"/> Mind, and imbitters all its Reflections upon it ſelf: But, however that be, ſince the Pleaſures and charming Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions of Holineſs may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times miſſing; And ſince theſe Ways there are, at leaſt, of taking them from us, the Conſequence is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my preſent Purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>thoſe inward Diſquiets ought not to drive us to any diſtrust of Mercy, or Deſpondency of our own Eternal Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. That</hi> Comfort and Safety do not always dwell together; and we argue wrong, if we make <hi>the Want of Peace and Joy in believing,</hi> a Proof of our <hi>not believing at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. And now at length I am come to my <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Laſt</hi> Thing propoſed from the Text, which is, <hi>To lay down ſome Rules, whereby the Weakneſs of Faith may be diſtinguiſhed from the Want of it;</hi> and, how any Man, by examining his own Conſcience, may diſcern whether his imperfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief be conſiſtent with the Terms of Salvation or not.</p>
            <p>The Neceſſity of having ſome ſuch diſtinguiſhing Characters is very great, becauſe what I have ſaid upon the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:49873:219"/> Former Particulars is only deſigned to prove, That the Imperfections of our Faith are not always our Faults, but now and then our Misfortunes. This was a Support due to the Integrity and honeſt Endeavours of ſome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy good Perſons. But, when I urge thus much on Their Behalf, my Meaning is not, to encourage Others in their Security, who ought to be deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and yet are not. Some Caſes give Men unneceſſary Trouble, and ſcare them with imaginary Dangers: Others carry juſt Fear in them, and open all Hell, to Men ſo ſtupid and blind, that that they cannot, or will not ſee it. So that it is of mighty Conſequence, to open the Eyes of both Thoſe ſorts of Perſons; and to ſet each of their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in a true Light, that the One may be awakened from his frightful Dream, the Other from his pleaſant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding One; The Sorrowful rejoice in the vaniſhing of his Sorrows, and the Sinner have no leſs Cauſe to do ſo, in the timely Sight of his Miſery, and happy Care to prevent it.</p>
            <p>This were a Work well deſerving a larger and more particular treating, than I am now able to allow it; but
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:49873:220"/> however, ſome few General Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions carefully applied, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with what hath been ſaid on the Two former Heads, will be a ſufficient Direction to us in this Affair.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Such Imperfections in our Faith are very agreeable with our Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>as we our ſelves have not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily contributed to.</hi> There is, as I ſaid formerly, a Defect in Believing, which proceeds from the Myſterious Nature of the Doctrines propounded to us, and the Shortneſs of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, which are not large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to comprehend them. And this is ſuch a Defect, as Nature and not We are accountable for. But there is alſo Another, which Men make this only a Pretence for, and That is wholly their Own. For, though we are not able to conceive every Article of the Chriſtian Religion diſtinctly, and to render a Reaſon of every Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cety that captious Diſputers may load it with; yet, unleſs there be ſome Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair Dealing, of which we are Guilty to the blinding of our own Eyes, there is enough to be diſcovered for the Conviction of our Judgment, and bringing us into the Obedience of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:49873:220"/> Faith. Now indeed, if we firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult Fleſh and Blood, and take a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to Religion, becauſe itabridges us of ſome Pleaſures, and claps a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Reſtraint upon ſome Appetites, and expects that Humane Diſcourſe ſhould ſubmit to Divine Revelation; Upon Theſe Terms, the Succeſs of our Study in it is not like to be very great. But then the Diſappointment is entirely from our ſelves. For, when Men thus poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt pretend to examine, and give off diſſatisfied, it is becauſe their Minds are bribed and byaſſed againſt the Cauſe they undertake to judge. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God does indeed declare Truths of a more elevated kind; but the Principles he requires us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon are the ſame: And he gives Men leave to uſe all Arguments, that they think reaſonable in other Caſes, provided they will but yield their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent upon equal Terms. But if a Man reſolve beforehand, not to allow, that God can be Wiſer, or Greater than himſelf; if no Authority ſhall ſuffice to prove, that any thing above the reach of his own Reaſon ever came from Heaven, but all Mankind ſhall be eſteemed Lyars, rather than that
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:49873:221"/> Idol within his own Brain; if he diſcern beforehand, what Engagements theſe Doctrines, when allowed, draw him into; and cannot away with the Abſurdity of a Practice contradicting his Profeſſion; and upon that Account will not enſlave himſelf, nor tye up his own Hands; This alters the Caſe extreamly; Theſe are not Difficulties of Nature's but our Own making. God will vindicate his Inſtitution and his Truth, in ſevere Vengeance upon ſuch perverſe Wretches, and make a juſt Difference between thoſe that doubt, becauſe it is impoſſible for them to know perfectly; and them that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute and oppoſe, becauſe they are loth to find the Truth; ſlack to conſider, and unwilling to believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another very diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Character of this imperfect Faith, whether it be agreeable to the Terms of Salvation or not, is <hi>the Humility, or the Pride of the Man's Heart.</hi> For, where a Perſon is modeſt, and thinks meanly of himſelf, he will ſee, and bewail, and diligently endeavour to redreſs, the Grievances and Infirmities of his own Mind. His Ears will be open to Inſtruction and Reproof; his
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:49873:221"/> Underſtanding will not diſdain to captivate it ſelf to the Wiſdom of God, nor blaſpheme and rally the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations of the Holy Ghoſt, nor ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign all ſober Chriſtians of Creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Madneſs, for ſubmitting to a Voice from Heaven, the Teſtimony of Miracles, and the united Conſent of the Church in all Ages. He ſtudies the Scriptures reverently; confirms himſelf in what Reaſon may attain to, and what it cannot, he ſilently adores; His Ignorance is not wilful and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but he is ever deſirous of better Information; and, in the mean while, ſubmits quietly to the Determination of his Superiors, in diſputed Points, rather than he will diſturb the Peace and Order of the Church, for the ſake of Contradiction, or the Itch of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing any particular Conceit of his own. Such a Temper as This is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary and commendable, where no Man can know every Point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion perfectly, and but very Few have Advantages of examining nicely all that may be known. Now an Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit makes the beſt amends for ſuch Diſabilities in Speculation; And indeed, for all the Defects in Practice.
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:49873:222"/> Becauſe it keeps Men ſenſible of their Diſeaſes and Wants, and beſt qualified to receive a Cure for them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Pride, on the Contrary, not only makes Men Fools, but keeps them ſo. It fills them full of themſelves alone, and never looks, but through the Magnifying part of the Perſpective. It renders them deaf to all manner of Admonition, becauſe it never ſuffers them to ſuppoſe they want any; And, inſtead of growing wiſer and better, they are only exaſperated, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened the more in their Folly. In ſhort, take Faith in its utmoſt Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and you will find, in every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the ſame Event with that which our Saviour hath deſcribed in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <note n="*" place="margin">Luke 18. 9.</note> of the Phariſee and the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. He that deſcends into his own Breaſt, and ſadly reflects on his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs and Deficiencies: that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and condemns himſelf with a <hi>God be merciful to me a Sinner,</hi> or, as in the Text, cries out with Tears, <hi>Lord help my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> is likely enough to go down to his Houſe juſtified. <note n="†" place="margin">Pſal. 25. 9.</note> 
               <hi>The Meek will God guide in Judgment, and the Humble will he teach his Way.</hi> But when once a Man is come to a <hi>God I
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:49873:222"/> thank thee, that I am not as Other Men are;</hi> when he is blind to his Own Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and rips up thoſe of Others, to ſhelter, and excuſe his Own; This Man's Unbelief is not through Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but through Perverſeneſs and Choice. He continues ignorant and wicked, becauſe he will not learn; And there is no Remedy, but continue ſo he muſt; becauſe he thinks himſelf too wiſe and too good to be taught, and admoniſhed. His deſperate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is well obſerved by <hi>Solomon,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 26. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Seeſt thou a Man wiſe</hi> (he might have ſaid, holy too) <hi>in his own conceit, there is more hope</hi> of a Fool, or of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate Sinner, <hi>than of him.</hi> The One labours under a more raging and a more ſcandalous Diſtemper indeed; but the Other is poiſon'd ſecretly, and ſo fond of his Diſeaſe, that he hates his Antidote, and obſtructs all the Methods of Recovery.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Weakneſs of Faith, and Defects in Practice are known to be conſiſtent with Safety, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe or the Neglect of proper Means to ſtrengthen it.</hi> For it is not enough, that we have not wilfully contributed to our paſt Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:49873:223"/> nor yet that we lament or are ſeriouſly concerned for our <hi>preſent,</hi> unleſs to both theſe we add Vigilance and care, to prevent thoſe that we are ſubject to, for the <hi>future.</hi> He that feels himſelf perplexed with Doubts and Difficulties in Religion, muſt <hi>ask Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> and labour after it with Meekneſs and Diligence. He that finds his Faith weak in influencing his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, muſt take all Opportunities of faſtening good Principles on his Mind; and continually quicken and rouſe himſelf up by Holy Motions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances; and drive the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions deeper, that they may be ever preſent, and ever vigorous, to draw out into uſe, and ward off every Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation that beſets him. The Man that languiſhes in his Devotion, muſt raiſe and inflame his Zeal, by all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Preparations to Prayer; by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtring himſelf from Buſineſs and Care, as much as Conveniently he may; fixing his Mind with Reverent Apprehenſions of the Majeſty he kneels before, and the infinite Importance of the Bleſſings he prays for. He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and thinks his Regret for paſt Offences leſs afflicting than it ought,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:49873:223"/> muſt work himſelf into as deep Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe as poſſibly he can; And expreſs his Sincerity and the Senſe of his Soul, by ſorrowing in Proportion for his Sin, as Nature determines him to do upon Other Occaſions of Grief and Sadneſs: And ſo of the Reſt of the Caſes mentioned heretofore. For, tho' God make Allowances for Nature and unavoidable Infirmities; yet he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects we ſhould not improve theſe into Wilful Tranſgreſſions and Habits of Vice. But on the contrary, that we withſtand and ſtrive againſt them; and proceed as far as we can, toward the correcting and curing of them. He does not expect, that every Man ſhould be equally Knowing, or equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conſiderate, or equally Devout, or Contrite; But he requires, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ſhould know as much as he can, and make his Belief as practical and effectual as he can, and Pray as fervently, and do Good as delightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Mourn for his Wickedneſs as affectionately, as he is able. For, This is the only Mark of our Integrity, and that which will take off all the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of corrupt Nature, not to make our Misfortunes a Pretence for real
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:49873:224"/> Faults; nor, from the neceſſary Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to which we all are liable, to take occaſion of Tranſgreſſing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſely, and covering our own Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs and wilful Neglects.</p>
            <p>And to all theſe things we muſt add a <hi>Fourth</hi> Sign, which is, <hi>Frequent and earnest Applications for Strength and Grace, to Him who is able to ſupport and perfect us.</hi> To our Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould come; And, if we be Sincere, we ſhall come (like Him in the Text) with ſtrong Cries, and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Contention of Heart and Voice. We ſhall beg his Aſſiſtance againſt our Failings, and his Comforts againſt our Sorrows and ſad Miſgivings of Heart; that he would protect us in our Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Temptations, and give us a right Judgment of his Dealings with us; that he would ſcatter our Doubts and Diſtractions; and diſpell thoſe Clouds, which intercept the joyful Light of his Countenance from us. And in all theſe, and in all other Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a weak Faith, <hi>Lord, we believe</hi> thou canſt, and therefore we pray, that thou of thy Goodneſs wilt <hi>help our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief;</hi> ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:49873:224"/> ſettle us in thy Truth: Yea, <hi>We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee good Lord, that it may pleaſe thee to ſtrengthen ſuch as do ſtand, and to comfort and help the Weak-hearted, and to raiſe up them that fall, and finally to beat down Satan under our Feet.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>THE ſeveral Circumſtances of our Bleſſed Saviour's Paſſion are related by the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, in ſo particular, ſo moving a Manner, as muſt needs argue thoſe
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:49873:225"/> Men extreamly ſtupid and inſenſible, upon whom they do not make a very lively and vigorous Impreſſion. Now the Purpoſes this Account is deſign'd to ſerve, are principally theſe Two; To excite our Thankfulneſs and Love, to Him who ſubmitted to undergo ſuch bitter things for us; And to work us up to an irreconcilable Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt Sin, the wretched Cauſe of all his Sufferings. And, What can kindle our Love, and enflame our Hearts with Zeal and Gratitude, if the Contemplation of his Agonies and Pains, the Tortures of his Body, and the Amazement, and exceeding Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of his Soul will not, to which he voluntarily expoſed himſelf, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Puniſhment of our Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? What can preſent us with a more frightful Image of the Wrath of God, and the Horrors of a ſelf-condemning Conſcience, than thoſe Sweats of Blood, that Heavineſs even unto Death, which this Tragical Scene in the Garden ſets before our Eyes? How ſhall wicked Sinners bear the Fury of an incenſed God, ſmoaking in Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance againſt them, when the Heat of it was ſo violent againſt his own
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:49873:226"/> moſt innocent and dearly beloved Son, ſuſtaining the Repreſentation only, of Sinners, but who himſelf had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done any Sin? How exquiſite muſt be the Amazement, how darting and raging the Pangs of Offences un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned; when He, whoſe Mind had nothing to reproach him with, trembled and ſunk under the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of that Wrath, which Others had provoked? How inſupportable muſt be that Load of Terror and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh? How dire and diſmal that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Spirit, which wicked Men draw down upon their own Heads; when He, who in Kindneſs took the Burden, which himſelf had in no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree deſerved, yet was almoſt cruſhed with the mighty Weight; and with moſt vehement Importunity deſired, if it were poſſible, a Releaſe from the approaching Miſery? For ſo he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly does, in thoſe Words now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to your Conſideration. He withdrew from his Diſciples, he pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out his Soul to God, he ſhewed him of his Terror and Trouble, and kneeling down, with all poſſible Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, with the utmoſt Earneſtneſs humane Nature was capable of, with
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:49873:226"/> all that even this preſent, this unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd Affliction could inſpire, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaying, <hi>Father, if thou be Willing, remove this Cup from me; nevertheleſs, not My Will, but Thine be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to this Text, I am not very ſollicitous to compare and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile it with thoſe differing Forms of Expreſſion, which the other Goſpels have given us in this Matter. All that is neceſſary of that Kind, will fall in occaſionally, under ſome or other Head of my Diſcourſe. And That can be but little, ſince the Subſtance of this Prayer is the ſame, in all the Evangeliſts. And any of the Terms, they have left it us in, will be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerviceable to the Uſe I intend to make of it.</p>
            <p>Now that is Two-fold:

                  <item>1. <hi>First,</hi> The Compellation, or Manner of Addreſs, in that firſt Word, <hi>Father.</hi>
                  </item>

                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Reſervation, with which that requeſt is preferred. <hi>If thou be willing,</hi> &amp;c.</item>

                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> Here is the Compellation, or Manner of Addreſs, <hi>Father; O my Father,</hi> as <note n="†" place="margin">Matth. 26. 39.</note> St. <hi>Matthew; Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mark 14. 36.</note> St. <hi>Mark;</hi> Which Exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the One, and the Doubling of the Word in the Other, add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Senſe; but only import the Vehemence and Affectionate Application of the Speaker. In our
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:49873:227"/> Lord's laſt dying Agonies upon the Croſs, we find him calling for Help under another Title; <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 27. 46.</note> 
               <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> A Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle denoting the unbounded Power of God; and proper for ſuch Extremity of Sufferings, as nothing leſs than Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence could be a ſufficient Succour for. But here, before Matters were come to that Extremity, and, when the Deſign of his Supplication was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Prevention of an approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Calamity, than for a reſcue out of Miſeries, which had almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd and ſwallow'd him up, the Character of <hi>Father</hi> is made choice of, as more agreeable to his Purpoſe. For This implyed the Duty of a Son, and that ready Obedience, of which he was now about to give the laſt, the moſt convincing, the beſt becoming Proof. This argued the Tenderneſs of that Relation; Thoſe Bowels, ſo apt to relent in all the Sufferings of Them, who derive their Nature and Being from us, and are a part of our own Fleſh and Subſtance. That en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Affection, which even the Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſheſt of Men cannot but feel, and the Beſt of Men find greater than can
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:49873:228"/> be expreſt. Much therefore need not be ſaid to incline a <hi>Father</hi>'s Pity, who in himſelf is ſo diſpoſed to compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Afflictions of a good Child, that it can hardly be imagined, he ſhould lay more upon ſuch a one, than is abſolutely neceſſary to be endur'd; Or, that even Thus much ſhould be impoſed, without wiſe and forcible Reaſons, and great degrees of Relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy, and a Violence upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. To all which if we add, that the tendereſt Reſentments of Earthly Parents are but a very feeble Image of the Love this Eternal Father bears to this Only, this Eternal Son; there needs no more to ſatisfy us, how ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant this Endearing Term was in our Saviour's Circumſtances; and that, if Any Conſideration could, this of God's being his <hi>Father,</hi> (ſuch a Father of ſuch a Son) muſt have prevailed, for the obtaining his Petition. And what that was I come now to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it is contained in that Clauſe, <hi>Remove this Cup,</hi> or (as another Evangeliſt hath it) <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 26. 39.</note>

            <p>I cannot think there is any Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſpend Time, either in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Metaphor, or enlarging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Reaſon of it. Scarce any Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure is more frequent in Scripture-Language, than that of a Man's <hi>Cup</hi> being put for his Portion, either of Proſperity, or Adverſity. To this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we read of God's being the Good Man's <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 16, 6. and 23. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Cup,</hi> and making <hi>his Cup to overflow,</hi> when the Bleſſings and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Piety and Vertue are deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. And ſo likewiſe of a <note n="‖" place="margin">Pſal. 75. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Cup of Trembling</hi> and <hi>Aſtoniſhment,</hi> of <hi>Red Wine</hi> and <hi>Bitter Dregs;</hi> when Miſery and ſevere Vengeance are denounced againſt bold and impenitent Sinners, whom God hath marked out for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Puniſhment, or utter Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. As little Reaſon is there to vindicate this Paſſage, from that very foreign and ſtrained Interpretation, which Some have endeavoured to put upon it; As if Chriſt here did depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, not any Calamity that threatned his own Perſon, but ſuch ſore Tryals as his Servants and ſuffering Members might afterwards be expoſed to, for the ſake of God and their Duty. For, ſetting aſide other Arguments, our
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:49873:229"/> Lord's own Words are a ſufficient Guide to us in this Matter. He, when rebuking St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s forward Zeal to reſcue him from thoſe Officers, who came to apprehend him, does it in theſe Terms, <note n="*" place="margin">John 18. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Put up thy Sword into the Sheath, the Cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> Now what Cup could it be, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> endeavoured to prevent his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's drinking, but thoſe Sufferings, and that Death, which the <hi>Jews</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bring upon him? And therefore we have all the Reaſon in the World to believe, that the ſame Sufferings and Death are meant by <hi>the Cup,</hi> he begs his Father to remove in the Text; Which yet, upon mature Conviction, that his Father did not think fit to remove, he ſettles himſelf preſently afterwards to drink, with full Reſolution and Contentment. The Only Argument, which prevailed with ſome Interpreters to ſeek out any other Conſtruction for theſe Words, ſeems to have been an Imagination, that the betraying any degree of Fear or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to dye in that cruel and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious Manner, was a Weakneſs unworthy of our Bleſſed Saviour, and
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:49873:229"/> inconſiſtent with his Deſign of coming into the World. The Force of which Pretence I ſhall be led to examine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Next Particular. In the mean while, taking it for granted, that his approaching Paſſion and Death are the Calamities, which he begs here to be delivered from; I proceed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Third</hi> Place, <hi>With what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, he prefers this Petition to his Father,</hi> expreſt in thoſe Words, <hi>If thou be willing; Father, if thou be willing, remove this Cup from me:</hi> Or, as it is in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ch. 26. 39.</note> 
               <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me.</hi> By comparing which Two Paſſages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, we are led to a right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, what ſort of Poſſibility is there intended. For, abſolutely ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>all things are poſſible with God,</hi> and it would ill become Us perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to pronounce, that God could not remit the Sins of the World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out requiring a Satisfaction, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent Compenſation for them, by the ineſtimable Blood of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and Divine Son. But yet, even this Aſſertion is capable of a very fair and true Senſe. For, although God,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:49873:230"/> conſidered as a Sovereign and Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Being, can do all things which do not imply a Contradiction; And, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Mercy be the undoubted Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of a Supream Law-giver, and may be extended to Whom, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what Terms, he ſhall think fit; Yet, if we conſider God, as a Wiſe and a Good Governor, One who is concern'd for the Honour and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of his Laws; and who, in the Myſterious Work of Man's Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did principally deſign to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Sin and Diſobedience, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Holineſs, and the vigorous Love and Practice of Virtue in the World: Thus it is very eaſy to diſcern, that, when he had once fixed theſe Rules and Meaſures to himſelf, it was not poſſible (according to that Scheme of Things) for this <hi>Cup</hi> to paſs away from our Bleſſed Redeemer. The Reaſon is, becauſe it is not poſſible for God, not to make choice of the Beſt Means, and ſuch as may moſt conduce to the Wiſeſt Purpoſes; Such as are moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in themſelves, and may be moſt Worthy of a Juſt and Good Governor. Now no Man can ſuppoſe, that Sin would have been ſo effectually diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:49873:230"/> if the Guilt of it had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed without any Conſideration at all; as it is now, by ſo ſevere and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary a Vengeance, taken upon it in the Perſon of our common Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative and Proxy, <hi>Christ Jeſus.</hi> God had not then ſo manifeſtly declared his Hatred and Reſentment againſt all manner of Ungodlineſs and Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Men; as now he hath, by ſo terribly afflicting even his own Son, when he vouchſafed to ſtand in the Place, and ſuſtain the Perſon, of Sinners: He had not inſtructed us ſo fully in the Value of our Souls, had he not ſhewed us by this aſtoniſhing Inſtance, how precious a Ranſom he thought them worth purchaſing at: Nor had he bound us to the Love of Him, and that Grateful Obedience, to which all are now even <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 14.</note> 
               <hi>conſtrained,</hi> who conſider the unſpeakable Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their God and Saviour; had he ſaved us with that which coſt him nothing; had we wanted that moſt ſenſible, that moſt powerful Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of not <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> 
               <hi>ſparing</hi> his own Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and only Begotten Son, but <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him up for us all.</hi> For This hath left us utterly inexcuſable, if we do
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:49873:231"/> not <hi>live to Him,</hi> who did not grudge <hi>to dye for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since therefore God intended to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in Men a due Senſe, how exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offenſive Sin was to him, and to work them up to a juſt Dread of the Puniſhment due for it; Since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Manners, and the Love of Him and Goodneſs, were the Effects aimed at in this Diſpenſation; Since the maintaining his Laws in juſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Authority, was a Deſign neceſſary, and becoming a Juſt and Holy Governor; And ſince Infinite Wiſdom muſt needs carry on theſe Purpoſes, by Methods moſt ſuitable and congruous to them; It follows from hence, that, in ſome ſenſe we may truly affirm, there was no Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Chriſt's being excuſed from ſuffering for Sinners. <hi>That is,</hi> Though, in the Nature of the Thing, and with regard to God's abſolute Sovereignty and Dominion, it was poſſible to have had the Sins of Mankind forgiven freely, and without any Atonement; yet with regard to the End and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which the Wiſdom of God, as a Governor of the World, and a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver to Men, had ſet to himſelf; we
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:49873:231"/> have Reaſon to think, it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Becauſe thoſe Ends, ſo far as can appear to Us, could not have been ſerved ſo well any other way. So that, whetherſoever of the Two Phraſes we take in this Prayer, <hi>If it be poſſible,</hi> or, <hi>If thou be willing,</hi> the Senſe comes all to one. And by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring, that this Cup might be taken away, <hi>if it were poſſible,</hi> our Saviour means ſuch a Poſſibility as is Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and depends upon the Will and Wiſdom of God. And ſince the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of the Divine Will are not like thoſe of Ours, taken up in Humour, or Paſſion, or Partial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, but conſtantly the Reſult of mature, and ſteddy, and unerring Wiſdom: Therefore the Importance of our Saviour's Requeſt, does, in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, come to thus much: That, if God ſaw any other Method of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about this great Work, which might be of equal Efficacy, with that of his enduring thoſe bitter Things, which were now approaching towards him; he would, in tenderneſs to His own Son, make uſe of That rather; and ſpare him all that Agony and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that Shame and Cruelty, All
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:49873:232"/> the intolerable, the unconceivable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Body and Mind, which, by his condeſcending to bear the Burden of his Father's Wrath due to ſinful Men, was even then already let looſe, and begun to be executed upon him.</p>
            <p>Now here it will be ſeaſonable to obſerve the true Reaſon of our Bleſſed Lord's addreſſing to his Father, as we ſee he does upon this Occaſion. For it may be objected, <q rend="inline">Was it poſſible, that our Saviour ſhould be ignorant what God had decreed to be done in this Matter? Does he not declare, that for <note n="*" place="margin">John 12. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>that Cauſe he came to that Hour,</hi> that he might glorify his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſuffering? Did he not in a very ſolemn and ſevere Manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove St. <hi>Peter,</hi> for ſuppoſing, that thoſe Sufferings ſhould not happen to him? Are not the Merits of thoſe Sufferings to be meaſured by the Conſtancy and Chearfulneſs, with which they were undergone? And, ſince we have undoubted Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ſeveral Martyrs, who even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in their Tortures, does not this ſhrinking back, and theſe earneſt Deſires of eſcaping them, argue in Chriſt a greater Irreſolution and
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:49873:232"/> Weakneſs of Mind, than even ſome of his Servants diſcovered, in the Confirmation of that Truth, which they gladly Sealed with their Blood? He took upon him our Fleſh, and, in marvelous Condeſcention, came into the World, on purpoſe that he might dye for Our Benefit, and in Our ſtead; And is his Love now ſo abated, and his Reſolution ſo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, that, when it comes to the Point, he ſhould decline Death; and, by praying to be excuſed from it, defeat the very end of his being made Mortal?</q> Theſe are Difficulties, which, with ſome colour of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be ſtarted from the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of our Lord in his Agonies, and the Requeſt made here to his Father; And fit it is, that they ſhould be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and this Action ſet in its true Light; which, if I miſtake not, will effectually be done, by attending care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to theſe following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> In regard our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had the Divine and Humane Nature both united in One Perſon; great Caution muſt be uſed in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Actions, that we do not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, in appropriating any of them
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:49873:233"/> to that Principle, to which they do not properly belong. For, as thoſe Works of Wonder, which exceeded or controuled all Powers of Created Nature, muſt be attributed to a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple Omnipotent and Divine; So in thoſe Others, which relate to Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Suffering, he muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to proceed upon a Principle purely Humane. Now praying to a Superior Being, is a Mark of Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Subjection; And undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pain and Death, implies Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Neither of which, God, as ſuch, is capable of. And therefore, if the Perſon, who was God and Man both, did Either of theſe; it is plain, he could do them but in One of thoſe Capacities. The Faculties of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature were totally ſuſpended upon ſuch Occaſions, and He proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, not in any Degree as <hi>God,</hi> but entirely as a mere and real <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Efficacy and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Man's Redemption conſiſting in this Union, it was neceſſary, that there ſhould be clear and undoubted Demonſtration given, of the Reality of both theſe Natures in Chriſt. And
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:49873:233"/> this had not been done, unleſs, as our Lord's Miracles evidenced him to be Very God, ſo all the eſſential and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable Properties and Affections of our Nature had ſo manifeſtly appeared in him, as to leave no juſt Suſpicion behind, whether he was Very Man. And, ſince the diſtinguiſhing Marks of this Nature lye principally in the Soul; it follows from thence, that ſufficient Proof of our Saviour's perfect Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity could not be given, either by his Death, or by any Bodily Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; except his Mind were beſides ſo affected with Theſe, as might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World, that he bore an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Reſemblance to us, in all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Paſſions and Inclinations of our Souls.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In this Soul of Ours it is eaſy to obſerve a Two-fold Principle, which we call <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Senſe.</hi> And, without entangling our ſelves in the Subtleties of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers or Schoolmen about this Matter, Experience, (which is of more Weight than Ten thouſand nice Diſtinctions) and a little ſerious Reflection upon our Selves, will plainly convince us, that we entertain different ſorts of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:49873:234"/> take different Meaſures, and aim at different Ends, as we are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the One, or other of theſe Principles. That, which we call <hi>Senſe,</hi> catches greedily at the Preſent, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues Eaſe, and Pleaſure, and Safety; and conſults the Preſervation and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Body. The Other, which we call <hi>Reaſon,</hi> enlarges our Proſpect; takes into Conſideration diſtant and future Objects; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades the foregoing ſome preſent Satisfactions, running ſome Hazards, enduring ſome Difficulties and Pains, for the Diſcharge of our Duty, and in Expectation of ſome greater Good in Reverſion, which will make us ample amends for what we now loſe or undergo upon its Account. The Former is the Principle of Animals; the Latter of Men and Chriſtians. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der That are comprehended all our Natural Paſſions, which are the ſecret Springs that move us in all we do; under This are Underſtanding and Judgment, which direct, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and bound, and over-rule thoſe Paſſions. But ſtill Both theſe are Conſtituent Parts of the Humane Soul: And, to ſuppoſe a Man void
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:49873:234"/> of Paſſions, or in no degree influenced by them, is as abſolute a <hi>Chimaera</hi> and Contradiction in Nature, as to ſuppoſe him without Reaſon. For Theſe Two Principles are as neceſſary to make One perfect Soul, as the Rational Soul and Humane Body are to make One per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Man. From whence we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That, The Weakneſs or Corruption of our Nature, as it ſtands now depraved with Sin and Luſt, does not conſiſt in being very tenderly and ſenſibly touched with Fear of <hi>preſent Evil,</hi> or ſtrong Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to <hi>preſent Good,;</hi> but in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thoſe Fears and Deſires to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, and take place, againſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Reaſon and Duty. Averſion to Pain, and Death, and the like, are Affections interwoven with our Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Frame and Conſtitution. <hi>Adam</hi> felt them in the State of Innocency. Otherwiſe, it had been vain to threaten his Tranſgreſſion with Death. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Threatning of Puniſhment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce; ſomething terrible, ſuch as the Perſon is ſuppoſed to be under dreadful Apprehenſions of, and will think himſelf concerned to avoid.
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:49873:235"/> And therefore it is no juſt Reflection upon the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> that He too felt the ſame Averſion to Dying, and Torment, and Shame. Infirmities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe Averſions may be called, in Compariſon of thoſe Perfections, which belong to God and unbodied Spirits. But then they are ſuch Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as All who partake of Bodies muſt have; And, if theſe things had been perfectly indifferent to our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, he could not have been our Saviour; that is, he could not have been a True Man.</p>
            <p>This is, what I think, a juſt and faithful Account of the Matter; Much to be preferred before that Reſolution, which ſome have given of it, as if the Vehemence of our Saviour's Paſſion had made him forget himſelf, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things in the Heat and Tranſport of his Mind, which he preſently checkt and corrected upon better Recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We indeed too often do ſo, but he never ceaſed to be Maſter of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and it ſeems too great a Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to repreſent him thus raſh and inconſiderate, which are the Effects of Corrupt Nature; though he thought it none to be like us, in all the inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:49873:235"/> Frailties of our Original and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Nature.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Now <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If Chriſt, as Man, could not be altogether indifferent, and unconcerned, at theſe ſevere Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, which he already felt in part, and ſaw coming upon him with great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence; Then ſure it could not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>become him to uſe all poſſible Means for declining them, and conſequently not to expreſs his Concern, by praying againſt them, with ſuch Reſerves and Limitations, as he does here in the Text. It was no diſparagement of his Love to Mankind, to deteſt Death and Sufferings; but in truth a higher Commendation of it; That, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo quick a Senſe, and ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate a Regret, he offered himſelf to Sufferings, ſo ungrateful to Humane Nature in general, ſo exceeding harſh and bitter to Him in particular. It en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced the Vertue of his Obedience, that he was content to give Proof of it, in ſo very tender and trying an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and, the more vehemently he wiſh'd for a Releaſe, the more Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious was his Submiſſion. For God does not expect, that Men ſhould have no unwillingneſs at all, to do, or to
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:49873:236"/> ſuffer what he appoints for them; but that they ſhould conquer their Unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, and bring themſelves ſo to acquieſce in His Choice, as to make it their Own. St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 12. 11.</note> that <hi>no ſuffering for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeemeth to be joyous, but grievous;</hi> And therefore Suffering is never choſen for its own ſake, but upon ſome other Conſideration, which may over-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the Grievouſneſs of it. Were it Eligible in it ſelf, there could be no Vertue in Chooſing it: For the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue conſiſts in conquering and denying our ſelves; that we may pleaſe God. And, the ſtronger our own Averſions are, the more we renounce our own Wills, and the more acceptable is our Complyance with the Divine Will. All Which may give us a worthy No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourth</hi> and Laſt Thing remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this Prayer, Namely, <hi>Our Lord's free and entire Reſignation of himſelf to his Father's Diſpoſal, in caſe his Wiſdom ſhould ſee fit not to grant this Request.</hi> And that is contained in the laſt Clauſe of the Verſe, <hi>Nevertheleſs, not My Will, but Thine be done.</hi> And here
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:49873:236"/> again we are aſſaulted with another Objection, concerning the Contrariety of Chriſt's <hi>Humane Will,</hi> by which he declined Sufferings and Death, to his <hi>Divine Will,</hi> which was the ſame with his Father's, and both accepted and decreed thoſe Sufferings. And This, if admitted, would deſtroy, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Innocence, and argue him guilty of Sin. Since the very Eſſence and Guilt of Sin conſiſts in a ſetting up our own Will, in Oppoſition to the Will of God concerning us. Now, though it be true, that the Bleſſed <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> as partaking of Two Natures, had Two diſtinct Wills, proper to each of them; yet is it not by any means to be allowed, that Either of Theſe were contrary to the Other. A Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Inclinations indeed there was in Him, according to the different Motions and Tendencies of the Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Rational Appetite; and This, as was explained before, is no more than Every Man feels in himſelf; Such particularly, as we exerciſe in all thoſe, which are called <hi>Mixt Actions.</hi> When a Man ſubmits to take an unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latable Medicine, in order to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery from Sickneſs; or cuts off a
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:49873:237"/> Limb to prevent a Mortification; Nature ſtarts back, and would be gladly excuſed from ſuch ſevere Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods. But, when all Circumſtances are laid together, and we come to be thoroughly convinced of the Benefit and Neceſſity of ſuch Applications, we then prevail upon our ſelves to comply with them, and the <hi>Rational</hi> overcomes the <hi>Senſitive</hi> Principle in us. Now all this is the Act of One and the Same Will, moved by different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; and determined at laſt, by That, which, upon the whole Matter, appears the rather to be choſen; tho' at the Expence of ſome Difficulty and Trouble to us. Thus our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, according to the Natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Senſe,</hi> deſired a Deliverance from his approaching Pains; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Principle of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which was equally natural to him as Man, he accepted thoſe Pains, and conformed his Humane to the Divine Will. But That, which clears him from all Repugnance to the Will of his Father, is, that he proceeded upon different Motives; The Natural Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Suffering diſpoſed him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it; but the Senſe of his Duty,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:49873:237"/> and the Proſpect how Neceſſary and Beneficial that Suffering would be, made him entirely ſatisfied with it, and got the better of that Averſion. And conſequently, though there was in this Action a Diverſity, yet is there no Contrariety of Wills; becauſe theſe Diſpoſitions to ſuffer, and not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, did not proceed from the ſame Principle, nor were oppoſed in the ſame Reſpect.</p>
            <p>The Schools have a Diſtinction, which may perhaps help to illuſtrate this Matter yet a little more fully. They tell us of a <hi>General</hi> and of a <hi>Definite</hi> or <hi>Determinate</hi> Will of God. All our Natural Inclinations and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of what Kind ſoever, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to the <hi>General</hi> Will of God. For he endued us with them, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all thoſe Motions, by which we feel our ſelves affected from them. But now the <hi>Determinate</hi> Will of God hath impoſed upon us certain Laws, and Conditions, and Reſtraints; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and beyond which thoſe Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations muſt not be indulged in ſome particular Caſes. Now from hence it follows, that None of our Natural Inclinations and Averſions are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:49873:238"/> to God, or contrary to his Will, <hi>generally ſpeaking,</hi> and <hi>in their own Nature;</hi> And that they are ſo Then only, when we ſuffer them to take Place, againſt his <hi>particular</hi> Will; which hath confined them, within ſome certain Rules, and upon ſpecial Emergencies. From hence it follows again; <hi>That,</hi> even in ſuch Reſerved Caſes, Theſe Motions are not ſinful, provided we take Care to keep them within due Bounds, and in a conſtant Subordination to Reaſon and God's Commands. For the Deſign of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God is not to extinguiſh our Natural Appetites, and make us ceaſe to be Men; but to reduce thoſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites to Obedience, and ſo make us Good Men. And this is done effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when Senſe is ſubjected to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and both our Senſitive and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Mind are ſubject to the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; notwithſtanding all the Byaſs of Infirm Nature, which draws ſo ſtrongly the other Way. And conſequently the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in the Words now before us, did not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect any thing amiſſe in the former part of his Prayer. Nor was that Requeſt of having this bitter Cup removed from
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:49873:238"/> him, the Effect of Raſhneſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking Paſſion; But it had all the Perfection requiſite for his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſh'd Innocence, and for a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to all his Followers, under any ſort of Difficulties and Tryals: Becauſe it was tempered with that no leſs eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Branch of the ſame Prayer; and this laſt Reſolution makes one moſt u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform Act of the ſame Humane Choice, <hi>Nevertheleſs, not My Will, but Thine be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I now paſs to the <hi>Second</hi> Thing propounded from my Text, and ſhall raiſe from hence ſome Obſervations for our Practice. But theſe are ſo Plain and Obvious, that, after what hath been ſaid, I cannot; And indeed, if what hath been ſaid be duly attended to, I need not, do any more, than juſt to mention them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> From our Saviour's uſing that Title of <hi>Father,</hi> in the extream Anguiſh and Bitterneſs of his Soul, We may be admoniſhed, <hi>what Thoughts it will become us to entertain of God, in the Time of Diſtreſs and ſore Affliction.</hi> That theſe Things ought not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:49873:239"/> us in our Duty, or abate our Love of God; or tempt us to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that he hath laid aſide all Care and Tenderneſs for Us. 'Tis true, Adverſity is very often a Scourge for Faults; and We, who have all of us been diſobedient Children, and have deſerved to be chaſtized, ought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to make our Amendment One happy Fruit of it. But This is not ſo ſtrictly and univerſally true, that the Proportion of any Man's Wickedneſs, or the Place he holds in God's Favour, ſhould be meaſured by the Quality or the Degree of his Sufferings. <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Bleſſed, was the <hi>Lamb of God, without Blemiſh and without Spot, He never did Sin, neither was Guilt found in his Mouth,</hi> and yet never was there any Sorrow like unto His Sorrow. He was the beſt <hi>Beloved Son</hi> of God, in <hi>whom his Soul delighted</hi> and <hi>was well pleaſed;</hi> and never did he delight more in Him, than at that very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, when he Sweat Drops of Blood, and poured out his Life in inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Agonies upon the Croſs. This Example then ought to comfort and ſuſtain us under our heavieſt Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; by an Aſſurance, that, how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:49873:239"/> ſoever we may ſeem to be dealt with, yet the Weight of our Burden is no Argument that God hath caſt us out of his Care and Protection; that our Sorrows are capable of becoming freſh and greater Endearments, and that even in the midſt of his Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he does not ceaſe to retain for his ſuffering Children, the Bowels of a moſt tender and affectionate Father.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are likewiſe taught by this Example, in <hi>what manner we ought to addreſs to this Father for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</hi> That it is no Offence, to wiſh and pray for a Deliverance from thoſe Troubles, which it cannot be eaſy for Fleſh and Blood to undergo. He that made us, conſiders How, and Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are made; and he does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that we ſhould attain to ſuch an Indifference, as our preſent Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not capable of. He allows us to decline Suffering by all Prudent and Lawful Methods; He does not require that we ſhould be inſenſible of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, when they come thick and heavy upon us. But even this tender Senſe we have of them he commands us ſo to moderate, as to leave both the
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:49873:240"/> Meaſure, and the Continuance of our Tryals to his Diſpoſal. We may ſhew him freely of our Trouble; We may complain of the Uneaſineſs we feel; We may propoſe our Wants and our Wiſhes; But, though we may, and ſhall do well to Propoſe them, we muſt not preſume to Preſcribe to Him. When we have expreſt our own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, we muſt reſt our ſelves upon the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of this Father, not doubting, but he knows better what is fit for us, than we do how to chooſe for our ſelves; And that what he knows beſt, his Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Care and Prudent Affection will not fail to order, for all thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who maintain that Deference due to His Character and Theirs; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their Obedience, and quiet Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to whatever he ſees conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to appoint for them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Paſſage ſhews, <hi>what ſort of Submiſſion God requires from us, to all the ſeverer Diſpenſations of Providence.</hi> And That is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Our Will to His. Not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enduring what we cannot avoid, for this is a Submiſſion of Rebels and
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:49873:240"/> Slaves, of Brutes and Wild Beaſts, when tyed and chained down to what they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not run away from. We are not able to contend with God, or break looſe from That, which muſt be endured, whether we will or no. But we muſt even be Willing to endure, and not have ſo much as the Diſpoſition to reſiſt. When we are ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that He hath determined any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us, We muſt prefer thoſe Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations before our own Deſires, and make His Choice our Own. Aſſuring our ſelves, that This is beſt for us, and making our Wills ſtoop and bend to God's. And This cannot be unreaſonable, when we reflect that his Proceedings are always agreeable to Equity, and Juſtice, and perfect Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that all His Intentions are full of Kindneſs; and that every Event will at laſt turn to our Advantage, if our ſelves do not obſtruct the Deſign and good Effect of it. And, though in particular Caſes, it may not be eaſy to diſcern This, or bring our ſelves to ſo reſigned a Temper; yet poſſible it is, with the Aſſiſtance of his Grace, and ſtrictly agreeable to that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Deſire of having all things <hi>work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our Good.</hi> A Good, which we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver purſue ſo Regularly, ſo Effectually, as when we yield our ſelves up entirely to God's Diſpoſal; and beg that not <hi>Our</hi> Will, but <hi>His may be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> From hence we are directed how <hi>to judge of the Succeſs of our Prayers.</hi> That they are not always loſt and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:49873:241"/> when the particular thing we ask is not granted; but often anſwered in the moſt beneficial Manner, when we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them to be denied and utterly reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. This Son of his Love never prayed in vain, and though his bitter Cup was not removed, yet he had an Angel ſent to ſtrengthen him, and the Fruit of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings is endleſs and unſpeakable. And We, in like manner, muſt reckon our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions well received, and happily return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us; Not only when we are reſcued <hi>from</hi> our Troubles, but when we are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported <hi>under</hi> them, and rewarded <hi>for</hi> them. In ſuch Caſes God chooſes better for us, than we ſhould have done; And, however a Releaſe might be more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſute with our preſent Inclinations; yet his Methods turn to greater Account. He afflicts becauſe it is good for us to be afflicted; and refuſes only ſuch things, as it would be unkind in him to give. And therefore, All we have to do, is to refer our ſelves and all our Affairs to Him; and to beg that he would <note n="*" place="margin">Commu. Service.</note> ſo <hi>aſſiſt us in all our Supplications and Prayers, that we may ever be diſpoſed to the Attainment of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Salvation, and among all the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Chances of this Mortal Life, may be defended by his moſt gracious and ready Help, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Amen.</p>
